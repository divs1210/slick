# The Slick Programming Language Specification

## Version of January 27, 2021

## Introduction

This is a reference manual for the Slick programming language. It is based on the [Go Programming Language Specification](https://golang.org/ref/spec) and the contents are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/). The paragraphs on [Quotation](#Quotation) and [Quasiquotation](#Quasiquotation) are based on the [Revised^7 Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme](https://small.r7rs.org). The section on [Tokens](#Tokens) is inspired by [Common Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp).

Slick is a general-purpose language designed as a Lisp syntax for the Go programming language.

The grammar is compact and simple to parse, allowing for easy analysis by automatic tools such as integrated development environments.

Todo:

* funcall and readtable forms to influence translation to Go (to implement)

## Notation

The syntax is specified using Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF):

```
Production  = production_name "=" [ Expression ] "." .
Expression  = Alternative { "|" Alternative } .
Alternative = Term { Term } .
Term        = production_name | token [ "…" token ] | Group | Option | Repetition | Splicing .
Group       = "(" Expression ")" .
Option      = "[" Expression "]" .
Splicing    = "[[" Expression "]]" .
Repetition  = "{" Expression "}" .
Requirement = "{" Expression "}1" .
```

Productions are expressions constructed from terms and the following operators, in increasing precedence:

```
|    alternation
()   grouping
[]   option (0 or 1 times)
[[]] splicing (enclosed alternatives can appear in any order)
{}   repetition (0 to n times)
{}1  requirement (exactly 1 time)
```

Lower-case production names are used to identify lexical tokens. Non-terminals are in CamelCase. Lexical tokens are enclosed in double quotes "" or back quotes ``.

The form `a … b` represents the set of characters from `a` through `b` as alternatives. The horizontal ellipsis `…` is also used elsewhere in the spec to informally denote various enumerations or code snippets that are not further specified. The character `…` (as opposed to the three characters `...`) is not a token of the Slick language.

## Source code representation

Source code is Unicode text encoded in [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8). The text is not canonicalized, so a single accented code point is distinct from the same character constructed from combining an accent and a letter; those are treated as two code points. For simplicity, this document will use the unqualified term _character_ to refer to a Unicode code point in the source text.

Each code point is distinct; for instance, upper and lower case letters are different characters. 

Implementation restriction: For compatibility with other tools, a compiler may disallow the NUL character (U+0000) in the source text. 

Implementation restriction: For compatibility with other tools, a compiler may ignore a UTF-8-encoded byte order mark (U+FEFF) if it is the first Unicode code point in the source text. A byte order mark may be disallowed anywhere else in the source. 

### Characters

The following terms are used to denote specific Unicode character classes:

```
newline        = #| the Unicode code point U+000A |# .
unicode_char   = #| an arbitrary Unicode code point except newline |# .
unicode_letter = #| a Unicode code point classified as "Letter" |# .
unicode_digit  = #| a Unicode code point classified as "Number, decimal digit" |# .
```

In [The Unicode Standard 8.0](https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode8.0.0/), Section 4.5 "General Category" defines a set of character categories. Slick treats all characters in any of the Letter categories Lu, Ll, Lt, Lm, or Lo as Unicode letters, and those in the Number category Nd as Unicode digits.

### Letters and digits

The underscore character _ (U+005F) is considered a letter.

```
letter        = unicode_letter | "_" .
decimal_digit = "0" … "9" .
binary_digit  = "0" | "1" .
octal_digit   = "0" … "7" .
hex_digit     = "0" … "9" | "A" … "F" | "a" … "f" .
```

## Lexical elements

### Comments

Comments serve as program documentation. There are three forms:

1. _Line comments_ start with the character `;` and stop at the end of the line. 
2. _Block comments_ start with the character sequence `#|` and stop with the first subsequent character sequence `|#`. Occurrences of `#|` and `|#` can be nested. Each occurrence of `#|` within an already open `#|` increases a level counter by one, and each occurrence of `|#` decreases that level counter. The block comment is completed when the level counter drops to 0.
3. _Form comments_ start with the character sequence `#;` and stop at the end of the immediately following form.

A comment cannot start inside a [rune](#rune-literals) or [string literal](#string-literals), or inside a comment.

Note: When Slick code is translated to Go code, comments are printed using Go's line comment syntax, to avoid issues with inadvertent occurrences of `/*` or `*/`. When line comments are printed during translation, the subsequent comment is always prepended with an empty character, to avoid inadvertent uses of compiler pragmas. For intentional uses of compiler pragmas, use a [`DeclareDecl`](#declare-declarations).

### Tokens

#### Rune syntax types

Slick distinguishes between the following rune syntax types:

* _White space_ is skipped and ignored during parsing of Slick source code, but only used for separating tokens. This includes all space characters as defined by Unicode's White Space property; in the Latin-1 space this is `#\\t`, `#\\n`, `#\\v`, `#\\f`, `#\\r`, `#\\s`, `U+0085 (NEL)`, `U+00A0 (NBSP)`. Other definitions of spacing characters are set by category Z and property `Pattern_White_Space`.

* _Macro runes_ trigger special parsing. Each macro rune has an associated reader macro function that implements its particular parsing behavior. Such a mapping from a macro rune to a parsing function can be defined as part of a [read table todo](#). A reader macro function either returns a value, which then becomes the token that is being returned by the Slick reader; or else it returns `nil` (of type `(interface)`) to indicate that the runes processed by the reader macro function are being ignored (for example as part of [comment syntax](#comments)). A macro rune is either _terminating_ or _non-terminating_. If a non-terminating macro rune occurs in the middle of a token, the corresponding reader macro function is not called, but instead the macro rune becomes part of the current token. A terminating macro rune, on the other hand, terminates a current token, and the corresponding reader macro function is called. If a rune is a dispatching macro rune, then another rune is read from the input, which becomes the _subrune_ that is looked up in the dispatch table associated with the dispatching macro rune. The reader macro function associated with the subrune is called, and the return value is handled in the same way as for regular macro runes.

* _Digits_ trigger parsing of [integer](#integer-literals), [floating point](#floating-point-literals) or [imaginary](#imaginary-literals) literals. All numeric literals start with a digit. This includes all digit characters as defined by Unicode's Decimal Digit property.

* The remaining _valid runes_ include all characters from `#\!` to `#\~` (inclusive) and all runes as defined by Unicode's category L.

#### Reader algorithm

1. The reader reads and discards all [white space runes](#rune-syntax-types).

2. If at end of file, the reader returns `io.EOF`. Otherwise, the reader reads one rune `r` and dispatches according to its syntax type in the following steps.

3. If `r` is a macro rune, then the corresponding reader macro function is looked up in the current readtable and called. If the reader macro function returns a value other than `nil` of type `(interface)`, then that value is returned by the reader. Otherwise, the reader algorithm continues with step 1.

4. If `r` is a dispatch macro rune, then another rune is read, the corresponding reader macro function is looked up in the current readtable and called. If the reader macro function returns a value other than `nil` of type `(interface)`, then that value is returned by the reader. Otherwise, the reader algorithm continues with step 1.

5. If `r` is a digit, then `r` and subsequent runes are read to parse a valid [integer](#integer-literals), [floating point](#floating-point-literals) or [imaginary](#imaginary-literals) literal. That literal value is then returned by the reader.

6. If `r` is a remaining valid rune, then `r` and subsequent runes are read to parse a [`lib:Symbol`](#package-lib), whose `String()` representation consists of these runes and any sequence of [valid runes](#rune-syntax-types), [digits](#rune-syntax-types), [non-terminating macro runes](#rune-syntax-types) uninterrupted by [white space](#rune-syntax-types). Such a symbol can represent possibly [exported](#exported-identifiers) [identifiers](#identifiers) or [operators](#operators-and-punctuation). That symbol is returned by the reader.

7. Otherwise, `r` is not a valid rune. The reader records this as an error, but continues with step 1.

#### Standard macro runes

The following runes are standard [macro runes](#rune-syntax-types) that trigger the call to default [reader macro functions](#rune-syntax-types). The only [non-terminating rune](#rune-syntax-types) in the following list is sharpsign `#`. All the other runes (left parenthesis `(`, right parenthesis `)`, single quote `'`, semicolon `;`, dobule quote `"`, backquote `` ` `` and comma `,`) are terminating.

##### Left parenthesis

A left parenthesis `(` triggers the reading of a list. The reader is called recursively to read successive values until a right parenthesis `)` is found. A list of the values is then returned by the reader macro function (of type [`(* list:Pair)`](#package-list)).

##### Right parenthesis

A right parenthesis `)` is invalid and triggers an error except when used in conjunction with a left parenthesis.

##### Single quote

A single quote `'` triggers the reading of another value. The reader macro function then returns a list with `quote` and that value as its two elements. See [Quotation](#quotation) for details on `quote`.

##### Semicolon

A semicolon triggers the reading of zero or more runes until the next newline rune. The reader macro function then returns `nil` (of type `(interface)`).

##### Double quote

A double quote `"` triggers the reading of zero or more runes until the next double quote. The reader macro function then returns a value of type [string](#string-types) consisting of the runes in between the two double quotes. For the precise syntax of double-quoted strings, see [`interpreted_string_lit`](#string-literals).

##### Backquote

A backquote `` ` `` triggers the reading of another value. The reader macro function then returns a list with `quasiquote` and that value as its two elements. See [Quasiquotation](#quasiquotation) for the details on `quasiquote`.

##### Comma

A comma ``,`` triggers an inspection of the next rune. If the next rune is a ``@``, then that rune is read. Independent of the presence of `@`, the reading of another value is then triggered. The reader macro function then returns a list with as first element `unquote` when the second rune is not `@`, and with `unquote-splicing` when the second rune is `@`; and as second element the value. See [Quasiquotation](#quasiquotation) for the details on `unquote` and `unquote-splicing`.

##### Sharpsign

Sharpsign triggers the read of another rune. It then uses that rune to dispatch to a default [reader macro function](#rune-syntax-types).

###### Sharpsign backquote

A sharpsign backquote ``#` `` triggers the reading of zero or more runes until the next backquote. The reader macro function then returns a value of type [string](#string-types) consisting of the runes in between the two double quotes. For the precise syntax of backquoted strings, see [`raw_string_lit`](#string-literals).

###### Sharpsign backslash

A sharpsign backslack `#\` triggers the reading of zero or more runes. The reader macro function then returns a value of type [rune](#numeric-types) according to the syntax for [rune literals](#rune-literals), which also determines how many runes are read.

###### Sharpsign semicolon

A sharpsign semicolon `#;` triggers the reading of another value. The reader macro function then returns `nil` (of type `(interface)`).

###### Sharpsign vertical bar

A sharpsign vertical bar `#|` triggers the reading of zero ore more runes until the occurrence of the exact two runes `|#`. The reader macro function then returns `nil` (of type `(interface)`).

Occurrences of `#|` and `|#` can be nested. Each occurrence of `#|` within an already open `#|` increases a level counter by one, and each occurrence of `|#` decreases that level counter. The reader macro function only returns `nil` when the level counter is 0.

### Semicolons

Slick does not use semicolons or line endings to terminate productions. Since it uses Lisp syntax, the syntax is never ambiguous by design. Instead, semicolons introduce [line comments](#comments).

### Identifiers

Identifiers name program entities such as variables and types. An identifier is a sequence of one or more letters and digits. The first character in an identifier must be a letter. The first character in an identifier cannot be an underscore if it has more than one character. (They are valid Go identifiers, but are reserved for internal use in Slick.)

```
identifier = letter { letter | unicode_digit } .
```

```
a
x9
ThisVariableIsExported
αβ
```

Some identifiers are [predeclared](#predeclared-identifiers).

### Keywords

The following identifiers are reserved and may not be used as user-defined identifiers.

```
break        default      func         interface    select
case         defer        go           map          struct
chan         else         goto         package      switch
const        fallthrough  if           range        type
continue     for          import       return       var
```

### Operators and punctuation

The following character sequences represent [operators](#operators) (including [assignment operators](#assignments)) and punctuation:

```
operator = ( "+" | "&"  | "+=" | "&="  | "&&" | "==" | "!="  | "(" | ")" |
             "-" | "|"  | "-=" | "|="  | "||" | "<"  | "<="  | "[" | "]" |
             "*" | "^"  | "*=" | "^="  | "<-" | ">"  | ">="  | "{" | "}" |
             "/" | "<<" | "/=" | "<<=" | "++" | "="  | ":="  | "," | ";" |
             "%" | ">>" | "%=" | ">>=" | "--" | "!"  | "..." | "." |  ":" |
                   "&^" |        "&^=" )
```
	 
### Integer literals

An integer literal is a sequence of digits representing an [integer constant](#constants). An optional prefix sets a non-decimal base: `0b` or `0B` for binary, `0`, `0o`, or `0O` for octal, and `0x` or `0X` for hexadecimal. A single `0` is considered a decimal zero. In hexadecimal literals, letters `a` through `f` and `A` through `F` represent values 10 through 15.

For readability, an underscore character `_` may appear after a base prefix or between successive digits; such underscores do not change the literal's value.

```
int_lit        = decimal_lit | binary_lit | octal_lit | hex_lit .
decimal_lit    = "0" | ( "1" … "9" ) [ [ "_" ] decimal_digits ] .
binary_lit     = "0" ( "b" | "B" ) [ "_" ] binary_digits .
octal_lit      = "0" [ "o" | "O" ] [ "_" ] octal_digits .
hex_lit        = "0" ( "x" | "X" ) [ "_" ] hex_digits .

decimal_digits = decimal_digit { [ "_" ] decimal_digit } .
binary_digits  = binary_digit { [ "_" ] binary_digit } .
octal_digits   = octal_digit { [ "_" ] octal_digit } .
hex_digits     = hex_digit { [ "_" ] hex_digit } .
```

```
42
4_2
0600
0_600
0o600
0O600       ; second character is capital letter 'O'
0xBadFace
0xBad_Face
0x_67_7a_2f_cc_40_c6
170141183460469231731687303715884105727
170_141183_460469_231731_687303_715884_105727

_42         ; an identifier, not an integer literal
42_         ; invalid: _ must separate successive digits
4__2        ; invalid: only one _ at a time
0_xBadFace  ; invalid: _ must separate successive digits
```

### Floating point literals

A floating-point literal is a decimal or hexadecimal representation of a [floating-point constant](#constants).

A decimal floating-point literal consists of an integer part (decimal digits), a decimal point, a fractional part (decimal digits), and an exponent part (`e` or `E` followed by an optional sign and decimal digits). The fractional part may be elided, but not the integer part; one of the decimal point or the exponent part may be elided. An exponent value exp scales the mantissa (integer and fractional part) by 10^exp.

A hexadecimal floating-point literal consists of a `0x` or `0X` prefix, an integer part (hexadecimal digits), a radix point, a fractional part (hexadecimal digits), and an exponent part (`p` or `P` followed by an optional sign and decimal digits). One of the integer part or the fractional part may be elided; the radix point may be elided as well, but the exponent part is required. (This syntax matches the one given in IEEE 754-2008 §5.12.3.) An exponent value exp scales the mantissa (integer and fractional part) by 2^exp.

For readability, an underscore character `_` may appear after a base prefix or between successive digits; such underscores do not change the literal value.

```
float_lit         = decimal_float_lit | hex_float_lit .

decimal_float_lit = decimal_digits "." [ decimal_digits ] [ decimal_exponent ] | decimal_digits decimal_exponent .
decimal_exponent  = ( "e" | "E" ) [ "+" | "-" ] decimal_digits .

hex_float_lit     = "0" ( "x" | "X" ) hex_mantissa hex_exponent .
hex_mantissa      = [ "_" ] hex_digits "." [ hex_digits ] | [ "_" ] hex_digits | "." hex_digits .
hex_exponent      = ( "p" | "P" ) [ "+" | "-" ] decimal_digits .
```

1.5e1_       ; invalid: _ must separate successive digits
```

### Imaginary literals

An imaginary literal represents the imaginary part of a [complex constant](#constants). It consists of an [integer](#integer-literals) or [floating-point](#floating-point-literals) literal followed by the lower-case letter `i`. The value of an imaginary literal is the value of the respective integer or floating-point literal multiplied by the imaginary unit _i_.

```
imaginary_lit = (decimal_digits | int_lit | float_lit) "i" .
```

For backward compatibility, an imaginary literal's integer part consisting entirely of decimal digits (and possibly underscores) is considered a decimal integer, even if it starts with a leading `0`.

```
0i
0123i         ; == 123i for backward-compatibility
0o123i        ; == 0o123 * 1i == 83i

0x1p-2i       ; == 0x1p-2 * 1i == 0.25i
```

### Rune literals

A rune literal represents a [rune constant](#constants), an integer value identifying a Unicode code point. A rune literal is expressed as one or more characters prepended by `#\`, as in `#\x` or `#\\n`. Any character may appear in this context except newline. A single character represents the Unicode value of the character itself, while multi-character sequences beginning with a backslash encode values in various formats.

The simplest form represents the single character; since Slick source text is Unicode characters encoded in UTF-8, multiple UTF-8-encoded bytes may represent a single integer value. For instance, the literal `#\a` holds a single byte representing a literal `a`, Unicode U+0061, value `0x61`, while `#\ä` holds two bytes (`0xc3 0xa4`) representing a literal `a`-dieresis, U+00E4, value `0xe4`.

Several backslash escapes allow arbitrary values to be encoded as ASCII text. There are four ways to represent the integer value as a numeric constant: `\x` followed by exactly two hexadecimal digits; `\u` followed by exactly four hexadecimal digits; `\U` followed by exactly eight hexadecimal digits, and a plain backslash `\` followed by exactly three octal digits. In each case the value of the literal is the value represented by the digits in the corresponding base.

Although these representations all result in an integer, they have different valid ranges. Octal escapes must represent a value between 0 and 255 inclusive. Hexadecimal escapes satisfy this condition by construction. The escapes `\u` and `\U` represent Unicode code points so within them some values are illegal, in particular those above `0x10FFFF` and surrogate halves.

After a backslash, certain single-character escapes represent special values:
```
\a   U+0007 alert or bell
\b   U+0008 backspace
\f   U+000C form feed
\n   U+000A line feed or newline
\r   U+000D carriage return
\s   U+0020 space
\t   U+0009 horizontal tab
\v   U+000b vertical tab
\\   U+005c backslash
\"   U+0022 double quote  (valid escape only within string literals)
```

All other sequences starting with a backslash are illegal inside rune literals.

```
rune_lit         = "#\" ( unicode_value | byte_value ) .
unicode_value    = unicode_char | little_u_value | big_u_value | escaped_char .
byte_value       = octal_byte_value | hex_byte_value .
octal_byte_value = `\` octal_digit octal_digit octal_digit .
hex_byte_value   = `\` "x" hex_digit hex_digit .
little_u_value   = `\` "u" hex_digit hex_digit hex_digit hex_digit .
big_u_value      = `\` "U" hex_digit hex_digit hex_digit hex_digit
                           hex_digit hex_digit hex_digit hex_digit .
escaped_char     = `\` ( "a" | "b" | "f" | "n" | "r" | "t" | "v" | `\` | `"` ) .
```

```

#\'          ; rune literal containing single quote character
#\aa         ; illegal: too many characters
#\\xa        ; illegal: too few hexadecimal digits
#\\0         ; illegal: too few octal digits
#\\uDFFF     ; illegal: surrogate half
#\\U00110000 ; illegal: invalid Unicode code point
```

### String literals

A string literal represents a [string constant](#constants) obtained from concatenating a sequence of characters. There are two forms: raw string literals and interpreted string literals.

Raw string literals are character sequences between back quotes prepended by `#`, as in ``#`foo` ``. Within the quotes, any character may appear except back quote. The value of a raw string literal is the string composed of the uninterpreted (implicitly UTF-8-encoded) characters between the quotes; in particular, backslashes have no special meaning and the string may contain newlines. Carriage return characters ('\r') inside raw string literals are discarded from the raw string value.

Interpreted string literals are character sequences between double quotes, as in `"bar"`. Within the quotes, any character may appear except newline and unescaped double quote. The text between the quotes forms the value of the literal, with backslash escapes interpreted as they are in [rune literals](#rune-literals) (except that `\'` is illegal and `\"` is legal), with the same restrictions. The three-digit octal (`\`_nnn_) and two-digit hexadecimal (`\x`_nn_) escapes represent individual _bytes_ of the resulting string; all other escapes represent the (possibly multi-byte) UTF-8 encoding of individual _characters_. Thus inside a string literal `\377` and `\xFF` represent a single byte of value `0xFF`=255, while `ÿ`, `\u00FF`, `\U000000FF` and `\xc3\xbf` represent the two bytes `0xc3 0xbf` of the UTF-8 encoding of character U+00FF.

```
string_lit             = raw_string_lit | interpreted_string_lit .
raw_string_lit         = "#`" { unicode_char | newline } "`" .
interpreted_string_lit = `"` { unicode_value | byte_value } `"` .
```

```
#`abc`               ; same as "abc"
#`\n
\n`                  ; same as "\\n\n\\n"
"\n"
"\""                 ; same as #`"`
"Hello, world!\n"
"日本語"
"\u65e5本\U00008a9e"
"\xff\u00FF"
"\uD800"             ; illegal: surrogate half
"\U00110000"         ; illegal: invalid Unicode code point
```

These examples all represent the same string:
```
"日本語"                                 ; UTF-8 input text
#`日本語`                                ; UTF-8 input text as a raw literal
"\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e"                    ; the explicit Unicode code points
"\U000065e5\U0000672c\U00008a9e"        ; the explicit Unicode code points
"\xe6\x97\xa5\xe6\x9c\xac\xe8\xaa\x9e"  ; the explicit UTF-8 bytes
```

If the source code represents a character as two code points, such as a combining form involving an accent and a letter, the result will be an error if placed in a rune literal (it is not a single code point), and will appear as two code points if placed in a string literal.

### The nil literal

The nil literal is the opening parenthesis followed by the closed parenthesis. It translates to the expression `(convert nil` [`(* list:Pair)`](#package-list)`)`.

```
nil_lit = "(" ")" .
```

## Constants

There are _boolean constants_, _rune constants_, _integer constants_, _floating-point constants_, _complex constants_, and _string constants_. Rune, integer, floating-point, and complex constants are collectively called _numeric constants_.

A constant value is represented by a [rune](#rune-literals), [integer](#integer-literals), [floating-point](#floating-point-literals), [imaginary](#imaginary-literals), or [string](#string-literals) literal, an identifier denoting a constant, a [constant expression](#constant-expressions), a [conversion](#conversions) with a result that is a constant, or the result value of some built-in functions such as `unsafe:Sizeof` applied to any value, `cap` or `len` applied to [some expressions](#length-and-capacity), `real` and `imag` applied to a complex constant and `complex` applied to numeric constants. The boolean truth values are represented by the predeclared constants `true` and `false`. The predeclared identifier [`iota`](#iota) denotes an integer constant.

In general, complex constants are a form of [constant expression](#constant-expressions) and are discussed in that section.

Numeric constants represent exact values of arbitrary precision and do not overflow. Consequently, there are no constants denoting the IEEE-754 negative zero, infinity, and not-a-number values.

Constants may be [typed](#types) or _untyped_. Literal constants, `true`, `false`, `iota`, and certain [constant expressions](#constant-expressions) containing only untyped constant operands are untyped.

A constant may be given a type explicitly by a [constant declaration](#constant-declarations) or [conversion](#conversions), or implicitly when used in a [variable declaration](#variable-declarations) or an [assignment](#assignments) or as an operand in an [expression](#expressions). It is an error if the constant value cannot be [represented](#representability) as a value of the respective type.

An untyped constant has a _default type_ which is the type to which the constant is implicitly converted in contexts where a typed value is required, for instance, in a [short variable declaration](#short-variable-declarations) such as `(:= i 0)` where there is no explicit type. The default type of an untyped constant is `bool`, `rune`, `int`, `float64`, `complex128` or `string` respectively, depending on whether it is a boolean, rune, integer, floating-point, complex, or string constant.

Implementation restriction: Although numeric constants have arbitrary precision in the language, a compiler may implement them using an internal representation with limited precision. That said, every implementation must:

* Represent integer constants with at least 256 bits.
* Represent floating-point constants, including the parts of a complex constant, with a mantissa of at least 256 bits and a signed binary exponent of at least 16 bits.
* Give an error if unable to represent an integer constant precisely.
* Give an error if unable to represent a floating-point or complex constant due to overflow.
* Round to the nearest representable constant if unable to represent a floating-point or complex constant due to limits on precision.

These requirements apply both to literal constants and to the result of evaluating [constant expressions](#constant-expressions).

## Variables

A variable is a storage location for holding a _value_. The set of permissible values is determined by the variable's [_type_](#types).

A [variable declaration](#variable-declarations) or, for function parameters and results, the signature of a [function declaration](#function-declarations) or [function literal](#function-literals) reserves storage for a named variable. Calling the built-in function [`new`](#allocation) or taking the address of a [composite literal](#composite-literals) allocates storage for a variable at run time. Such an anonymous variable is referred to via a (possibly implicit) [pointer indirection](#address-operators).

_Structured_ variables of [array](#array-types), [slice](#slice-types), and [struct](#struct-types) types have elements and fields that may be [addressed](#address-operators) individually. Each such element acts like a variable.

The _static_ type (or just _type_) of a variable is the type given in its declaration, the type provided in the `new` call or composite literal, or the type of an element of a structured variable. Variables of interface type also have a distinct _dynamic type_, which is the concrete type of the value assigned to the variable at run time (unless the value is the predeclared identifier `nil`, which has no type). The dynamic type may vary during execution but values stored in interface variables are always [assignable](#assignability) to the static type of the variable.

```
(var (x :type (interface)))  ; x is nil and has static type (interface)
(var (v :type (* T)))        ; v has value nil, static type (* T)
(= x 42)                     ; x has value 42 and dynamic type int
(= x v)                      ; x has value (convert nil (* T)) and dynamic type (* T)
```

A variable's value is retrieved by referring to the variable in an [expression](#expressions); it is the most recent value [assigned](#assignments) to the variable. If a variable has not yet been assigned a value, its value is the [zero value](#the-zero-value) for its type.

## Types

A type determines a set of values together with operations and methods specific to those values. A type may be denoted by a _type name_, if it has one, or specified using a _type literal_, which composes a type from existing types.

```
Type     = TypeName | TypeLit .
TypeName = identifier | QualifiedIdent .
TypeLit  = ArrayType | StructType | PointerType | FunctionType | InterfaceType | SliceType | MapType | ChannelType .
```

The language [predeclares](#predeclared-identifiers) certain type names. Others are introduced with [type declarations](#type-declarations). _Composite types_ — array, struct, pointer, function, interface, slice, map, and channel types — may be constructed using type literals.

Each type `T` has an _underlying type_: If `T` is one of the predeclared boolean, numeric, or string types, or a type literal, the corresponding underlying type is `T` itself. Otherwise, `T`'s underlying type is the underlying type of the type to which `T` refers in its [type declaration](#type-declarations).

```
(type-alias
  (A1 string)
  (A2 A1))

(type
  (B1 string)
  (B2 B1)
  (B3 (slice B1))
  (B4 B3))
```

The underlying type of `string`, `A1`, `A2`, `B1`, and `B2` is `string`. The underlying type of `(slice B1)`, `B3`, and `B4` is `(slice B1)`.

### Method sets

A type may have a _method set_ associated with it. The method set of an [interface type](#interface-types) is its interface. The method set of any other type `T` consists of all [methods](#method-declarations) declared with receiver type `T`. The method set of the corresponding [pointer type](#pointer-types) `(* T)` is the set of all methods declared with receiver `(* T)` or `T` (that is, it also contains the method set of `T`). Further rules apply to structs containing embedded fields, as described in the section on [struct types](#struct-types). Any other type has an empty method set. In a method set, each method must have a [unique](#uniqueness-of-identifiers) non-[blank](#blank-identifier) [method name](#interface-types).

The method set of a type determines the interfaces that the type [implements](#interface-types) and the methods that can be [called](#calls) using a receiver of that type.

### Boolean types

A _boolean type_ represents the set of Boolean truth values denoted by the predeclared constants _true_ and _false_. The predeclared boolean type is `bool`; it is a [defined type](#type-definitions).

### Numeric types

A _numeric type_ represents sets of integer or floating-point values. The predeclared architecture-independent numeric types are:
```
uint8       the set of all unsigned  8-bit integers (0 to 255)
uint16      the set of all unsigned 16-bit integers (0 to 65535)
uint32      the set of all unsigned 32-bit integers (0 to 4294967295)
uint64      the set of all unsigned 64-bit integers (0 to 18446744073709551615)

int8        the set of all signed  8-bit integers (-128 to 127)
int16       the set of all signed 16-bit integers (-32768 to 32767)
int32       the set of all signed 32-bit integers (-2147483648 to 2147483647)
int64       the set of all signed 64-bit integers (-9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807)

float32     the set of all IEEE-754 32-bit floating-point numbers
float64     the set of all IEEE-754 64-bit floating-point numbers

complex64   the set of all complex numbers with float32 real and imaginary parts
complex128  the set of all complex numbers with float64 real and imaginary parts

byte        alias for uint8
rune        alias for int32
```
The value of an _n_-bit integer is _n_ bits wide and represented using [two's complement arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two's_complement).

There is also a set of predeclared numeric types with implementation-specific sizes:
```
uint     either 32 or 64 bits
int      same size as uint
uintptr  an unsigned integer large enough to store the uninterpreted bits of a pointer value
```

To avoid portability issues all numeric types are [defined types](#type-definitions) and thus distinct except `byte`, which is an [alias](#alias-declarations) for `uint8`, and `rune`, which is an alias for `int32`. Explicit conversions are required when different numeric types are mixed in an expression or assignment. For instance, `int32` and `int` are not the same type even though they may have the same size on a particular architecture.

### String types

A _string type_ represents the set of string values. A string value is a (possibly empty) sequence of bytes. The number of bytes is called the length of the string and is never negative. Strings are immutable: once created, it is impossible to change the contents of a string. The predeclared string type is `string`; it is a [defined type](#type-definitions).

The length of a string `s` can be discovered using the built-in function [`len`](#length-and-capacity). The length is a compile-time constant if the string is a constant. A string's bytes can be accessed by integer [indices](#index-expressions) 0 through `(- (len s) 1)`. It is illegal to take the address of such an element; if `(at s i)` is the `i`'th byte of a string, `(& (at s i))` is invalid.

### Array types

An array is a numbered sequence of elements of a single type, called the element type. The number of elements is called the length of the array and is never negative.

```
ArrayType   = "(" "array" ArrayLength ElementType ")".
ArrayLength = Expression .
ElementType = Type .
```

The length is part of the array's type; it must evaluate to a non-negative [constant](#constants) [representable](#representability) by a value of type `int`. The length of array `a` can be discovered using the built-in function [`len`](#length-and-capacity). The elements can be addressed by integer [indices](#index-expressions) 0 through `(- (len a) 1)`. Array types are always one-dimensional but may be composed to form multi-dimensional types.

```
(array 32 byte)
(array (* 2 N) (struct ((x y) :type int32)))
(array 1000 (* float64))
(array 3 (array 5 int))
(array 2 (array 2 (array 2 float64)))
```

### Slice types

A slice is a descriptor for a contiguous segment of an _underlying array_ and provides access to a numbered sequence of elements from that array. A slice type denotes the set of all slices of arrays of its element type. The number of elements is called the length of the slice and is never negative. The value of an uninitialized slice is `nil`.

```
SliceType = "(" "slice" ElementType ")" .
```

The length of a slice `s` can be discovered by the built-in function [`len`](#length-and-capacity); unlike with arrays it may change during execution. The elements can be addressed by integer [indices](#index-expressions) 0 through `(- (len s) 1)`. The slice index of a given element may be less than the index of the same element in the underlying array.

A slice, once initialized, is always associated with an underlying array that holds its elements. A slice therefore shares storage with its array and with other slices of the same array; by contrast, distinct arrays always represent distinct storage.

The array underlying a slice may extend past the end of the slice. The _capacity_ is a measure of that extent: it is the sum of the length of the slice and the length of the array beyond the slice; a slice of length up to that capacity can be created by [_slicing_](#slice-expressions) a new one from the original slice. The capacity of a slice `a` can be discovered using the built-in function [`(cap a)`](#length-and-capacity).

A new, initialized slice value for a given element type `T` is made using the built-in function [`make`](#making-slices-maps-and-channels), which takes a slice type and parameters specifying the length and optionally the capacity. A slice created with `make` always allocates a new, hidden array to which the returned slice value refers. That is, executing
```
(make (slice T) length capacity)
```
produces the same slice as allocating an array and [slicing](#slice-expressions) it, so these two expressions are equivalent:
```
(make (slice int) 50 100)
(slice (new (array 100 int)) 0 50)
```

Like arrays, slices are always one-dimensional but may be composed to construct higher-dimensional objects. With arrays of arrays, the inner arrays are, by construction, always the same length; however with slices of slices (or arrays of slices), the inner lengths may vary dynamically. Moreover, the inner slices must be initialized individually.

### Struct types

A struct is a sequence of named elements, called fields, each of which has a name and a type. Field names may be specified explicitly (IdentifierList) or implicitly (EmbeddedField). Within a struct, non-[blank](#blank-identifier) field names must be [unique](#uniqueness-of-identifiers).

```
StructType    = "(" "struct" { "(" FieldDecl ")" } ")" .
FieldDecl     = IdentifierList [[ { ":type" Type }1 | ":tag" Tag  | ":documentation" string_lit ]] | EmbeddedField [[ ":tag" Tag | ":documentation" Documentation ]] .
EmbeddedField = TypeName | "(" "*" TypeName ")".
Tag           = string_lit .
Documentation = string_lit .
```

```
;; An empty struct.
(struct)

;; A struct with 6 fields.
(struct
  ((x y) :type int)
  (u :type float32)
  (_ :type float32 :documentation "padding")
  (A :type (* (slice int)))
  (F :type (func ())))
```

A field declared with no explicit `:type` is called an _embedded field_. An embedded field must be specified as a type name `T` or as a pointer to a non-interface type name `(* T)`, and `T` itself may not be a pointer type. The unqualified type name acts as the field name.

```
;; A struct with four embedded fields of types T1, (* T2), P:T3 and (* P:T4)
(struct
  (T1)               ; field name is T1
  ((* T2))           ; field name is T2
  (P:T3)             ; field name is T3
  ((* P:T4))         ; field name is T4
  ((x y) :type int)) ; field names are x and y
```

The following declaration is illegal because field names must be unique in a struct type:

```
(struct
  (T)        ; conflicts with embedded field (* T) and (* P:T)
  ((* T))    ; conflicts with embedded field T and (* P:T)
  ((* P:T))) ; conflicts with embedded field T and (* T)
```

A field or [method](#method-declarations) `f` of an embedded field in a struct `x` is called _promoted_ if `(slot x f)` is a legal [selector](#selectors) that denotes that field or method f.

Promoted fields act like ordinary fields of a struct except that they cannot be used as field names in [composite literals](#composite-literals) of the struct.

Given a struct type `S` and a [defined type](#type-definitions) `T`, promoted methods are included in the method set of the struct as follows:

* If `S` contains an embedded field `T`, the [method sets](#method-sets) of `S` and `(* S)` both include promoted methods with receiver `T`. The method set of `(* S)` also includes promoted methods with receiver `(* T)`.

* If `S` contains an embedded field `(* T)`, the method sets of `S` and `(* S)` both include promoted methods with receiver `T` or `(* T)`.

A field declaration may be followed by an optional string literal _tag_, which becomes an attribute for all the fields in the corresponding field declaration. An empty tag string is equivalent to an absent tag. The tags are made visible through a [reflection interface](https://golang.org/pkg/reflect/#StructTag) and take part in [type identity](#type-identity) for structs but are otherwise ignored.

```
(struct 
  ((x y) :type float64 :tag "") ; an empty tag string is like an absent tag
  (name :type string :tag "any string is permitted as a tag")
  (pos :tag "the order of :type and :tag does not matter" :type int)
  (_ :type (array 4 byte) :tag "ceci n'est pas un champ de structure"))

;; A struct corresponding to a TimeStamp protocol buffer.
;; The tag strings define the protocol buffer field numbers;
;; they follow the convention outlined by the reflect package.
(struct 
  (microsec :type uint64 :tag #`protobuf:"1"`)
  (serverIP6 :type uint64 :tag #`protobuf:"2"`))
```

### Pointer types

A pointer type denotes the set of all pointers to [variables](#variables) of a given type, called the _base type_ of the pointer. The value of an uninitialized pointer is `nil`.

```
PointerType = "(" "*" BaseType ")" .
BaseType    = Type .
```

```
(* Point)
(* (array 4 int))
```

### Function types

A function type denotes the set of all functions with the same parameter and result types. The value of an uninitialized variable of function type is `nil`.

```
FunctionType  = "(" "func" Signature ")" .
Signature     = [ Parameters [ Parameters ] ] .
Parameters    = "(" [ ParameterList ] ")" .
ParameterList = "(" ParameterDecl ")" { "(" ParameterDecl ")" } .
ParameterDecl = IdentifierList [ "..." ] Type .
```

Within a list of parameters or results, the names (IdentifierList) must all be present. Each name stands for one item (parameter or result) of the specified type and all non-[blank](#blank-identifier) names in the signature must be [unique](#uniqueness-of-identifiers). Parameter and result lists are always parenthesized.

The final incoming parameter in a function signature may have a type prefixed with `...`. A function with such a parameter is called _variadic_ and may be invoked with zero or more arguments for that parameter.

```
(func)            ; equivalent to (func ()) and (func () ())
(func ((x int)) ((_ int)))
(func (((a _) int) (z float32)) ((_ bool)))
(func (((a b) int) (z float32)) ((_ bool)))
(func ((prefix string) (values ... int)))
(func (((a b) int) (z float64) (opt ... (interface))) ((success bool)))
(func ((_ int) (_ int) (_ float64)) ((_ float64) (_ (* (slice int)))))
(func ((n int)) ((_ (func ((p (* T)))))))
```

### Interface types

An interface type specifies a [method set](#method-sets) called its _interface_. A variable of interface type can store a value of any type with a method set that is any superset of the interface. Such a type is said to _implement the interface_. The value of an uninitialized variable of interface type is `nil`.

```
InterfaceType             = "(" "interface" { ( MethodSpec | InterfaceTypeName ) } ")" .
MethodSpec                = "(" MethodName SignatureAndDocumentation ")" .
MethodName                = identifier .
SignatureAndDocumentation = [ Parameters [ Parameters [ Documentation ] ] ] .
InterfaceTypeName         = TypeName | "(" TypeName ":documentation" Documentation ")" .
```

An interface type may specify methods _explicitly_ through method specifications, or it may _embed_ methods of other interfaces through interface type names.

```
;; A simple File interface.
(interface
  (Read ((_ (slice byte))) ((_ int) (_ error)))
  (Write ((_ (slice byte))) ((_ int) (_ error)))
  (Close () ((_ error))))
```

The name of each explicitly specified method must be [unique](#uniqueness-of-identifiers) and not [blank](#blank-identifier).

```
(interface
  (String () ((_ string)))
  (String () ((_ string)) "illegal: String not unique")
  (_ ((x int)) () "illegal: method must have non-blank name"))
```

More than one type may implement an interface. For instance, if two types `S1` and `S2` have the method set
```
(func ((p T)) Read ((p (slice byte))) ((n int) (err error)))
(func ((p T)) Write ((p (slice byte))) ((n int) (err error)))
(func ((p T)) Close () ((_ error)))
```
(where `T` stands for either `S1` or `S2`) then the `File` interface is implemented by both `S1` and `S2`, regardless of what other methods `S1` and `S2` may have or share.

A type implements any interface comprising any subset of its methods and may therefore implement several distinct interfaces. For instance, all types implement the _empty interface_:
```
(interface)
```

Similarly, consider this interface specification, which appears within a [type declaration](#type-declarations) to define an interface called `Locker`:
```
(type (Locker (interface 
                (Lock)
                (Unlock))))
```

If `S1` and `S2` also implement
```
(func ((p T)) Lock () ()  … )
(func ((p T)) Unlock () ()  … )
```
they implement the `Locker` interface as well as the `File` interface.

An interface `T` may use a (possibly qualified) interface type name `E` in place of a method specification. This is called _embedding_ interface `E` in `T`. The [method set](#method-sets) of `T` is the _union_ of the method sets of `T`’s explicitly declared methods and of `T`’s embedded interfaces.

```
(type (Reader (interface
                (Read ((p (slice byte))) ((n int) (err error)))
                (Close () ((_ error)))))

(type (Writer (interface
                (Write ((p (slice byte))) ((n int) (err error)))
                (Close () ((_ error))))))

;; ReadWriter's methods are Read, Write, and Close.
(type (ReadWriter
        (interface
          (Reader :documentation
                  "includes methods of Reader in ReadWriter's method set")
          (Writer :documentation
                  "includes methods of Writer in ReadWriter's method set")))
```

A _union_ of method sets contains the (exported and non-exported) methods of each method set exactly once, and methods with the [same](#uniqueness-of-identifiers) names must have [identical](#type-identity) signatures.

```
(type (ReadCloser
        (interface
          Reader     ; includes methods of Reader in ReadCloser's method set
          (Close)))) ; illegal: signatures of (slot Reader Close) and Close are different
```

An interface type `T` may not embed itself or any interface type that embeds `T`, recursively.

```
;; illegal: Bad cannot embed itself
(type (Bad (interface Bad)))

;; illegal: Bad1 cannot embed itself using Bad2
(type (Bad1 (interface Bad2)))
(type (Bad2 (interface Bad1)))
```

### Map types

A map is an unordered group of elements of one type, called the element type, indexed by a set of unique _keys_ of another type, called the key type. The value of an uninitialized map is `nil`.

```
MapType = "(" "map" KeyType ElementType ")".
KeyType = Type .
```

The [comparison operators](#comparison-operators) `==` and `!=` must be fully defined for operands of the key type; thus the key type must not be a function, map, or slice. If the key type is an interface type, these comparison operators must be defined for the dynamic key values; failure will cause a [run-time panic](#run-time-panics).

```
(map string int)
(map (* T) (struct ((x y) :type float64)))
(map string (interface))
```

The number of map elements is called its length. For a map `m`, it can be discovered using the built-in function [`len`](#length-and-capacity) and may change during execution. Elements may be added during execution using [assignments](#assignments) and retrieved with [index expressions](#index-expressions); they may be removed with the [`delete`](#deletion-of-map-elements) built-in function.

A new, empty map value is made using the built-in function [`make`](#making-slices-maps-and-channels), which takes the map type and an optional capacity hint as arguments:
```
(make (map string int))
(make (map string int) 100)
```

The initial capacity does not bound its size: maps grow to accommodate the number of items stored in them, with the exception of `nil` maps. A `nil` map is equivalent to an empty map except that no elements may be added.

### Channel types

A channel provides a mechanism for [concurrently executing functions](#go-statements) to communicate by [sending](#send-statements) and [receiving](#receive-operator) values of a specified element type. The value of an uninitialized channel is `nil`.

```
ChannelType = "(" ( "chan" | "chan<-" | "<-chan" ) ElementType ")" .
```

The `chan<-` and `<-chan` identifiers specify channel types with a _direction_, _send_ or _receive_. A channel type `chan` is _bidirectional_. A channel may be constrained only to send or only to receive by [assignment](#assignments) or explicit [conversion](#conversions).

```
(chan T)          ; can be used to send and receive values of type T
(chan<- float64)  ; can only be used to send float64s
(<-chan int)      ; can only be used to receive ints

(chan<- (chan int))
(chan<- (<-chan int))
(<-chan (<-chan int))
(chan (<-chan int))
```

A new, initialized channel value can be made using the built-in function [`make`](#making-slices-maps-and-channels), which takes the channel type and an optional _capacity_ as arguments:
```
(make (chan int) 100)
```

The capacity, in number of elements, sets the size of the buffer in the channel. If the capacity is zero or absent, the channel is unbuffered and communication succeeds only when both a sender and receiver are ready. Otherwise, the channel is buffered and communication succeeds without blocking if the buffer is not full (sends) or not empty (receives). A `nil` channel is never ready for communication.

A channel may be closed with the built-in function [`close`](#close). The multi-valued assignment form of the [receive operator](#receive-operator) reports whether a received value was sent before the channel was closed.

A single channel may be used in [send statements](#send-statements), [receive operations](#receive-operator), and calls to the built-in functions [`cap`](#length-and-capacity) and [`len`](#length-and-capacity) by any number of goroutines without further synchronization. Channels act as first-in-first-out queues. For example, if one goroutine sends values on a channel and a second goroutine receives them, the values are received in the order sent.

## Properties of types and values

### Type identity

Two types are either _identical_ or _different_.

A [defined type](#type-definitions) is always different from any other type. Otherwise, two types are identical if their [underlying](#types) type literals are structurally equivalent; that is, they have the same literal structure and corresponding components have identical types. In detail:

* Two array types are identical if they have identical element types and the same array length.
* Two slice types are identical if they have identical element types.
* Two struct types are identical if they have the same sequence of fields, and if corresponding fields have the same names, and identical types, and identical tags. [Non-exported](#exported-identifiers) field names from different packages are always different.
* Two pointer types are identical if they have identical base types.
* Two function types are identical if they have the same number of parameters and result values, corresponding parameter and result types are identical, and either both functions are variadic or neither is. Parameter and result names are not required to match.
* Two interface types are identical if they have the same set of methods with the same names and identical function types. [Non-exported](#exported-identifiers) method names from different packages are always different. The order of the methods is irrelevant.
* Two map types are identical if they have identical key and element types.
* Two channel types are identical if they have identical element types and the same direction.

Given the declarations
```
(type-alias 
  (A0 (slice string))
  (A1 A0)
  (A2 (struct ((a b) :type int)))
  (A3 int)
  (A4 (func ((_ A3) (_ float64)) ((_ (* A0)))))
  (A5 (func ((x int) (_ float64)) ((_ (* (slice string)))))))

(type
  (B0 A0)
  (B1 (slice string))
  (B2 (struct ((a b) :type int)))
  (B3 (struct ((a c) :type int)))
  (B4 (func ((_ int) (_ float64)) ((_ (* B0)))))
  (B5 (func ((x int) (y float64)) ((_ (* A1))))))

(type-alias (C0 B0))
```
these types are identical:
```
A0, A1, and (slice string)
A2 and (struct ((a b) :type int))
A3 and int
A4, (func ((_ int) (_ float64)) ((_ (* (slice string))))), and A5
B0 and C0
(func ((x int) (y float64)) ((_ (* (slice string))))), (func ((_ int) (_ float64)) ((result (* (slice string))))), and A5
```

`B0` and `B1` are different because they are new types created by distinct [type definitions](#type-definitions); `(func ((_ int) (_ float64)) ((_ (* B0))))` and `(func ((x int) (y float64)) ((_ (* (slice string)))))` are different because `B0` is different from `(slice string)`.

### Assignability

A value `x` is assignable to a [variable](#variables) of type `T` ("`x` is assignable to `T`") if one of the following conditions applies:

* `x`'s type is identical to `T`.
* `x`'s type `V` and `T` have identical [underlying types](#types) and at least one of `V` or `T` is not a [defined](#type-definitions) type.
* `T` is an interface type and `x` [implements](#interface-types) `T`.
* `x` is a bidirectional channel value, `T` is a channel type, `x`'s type `V` and `T` have identical element types, and at least one of `V` or `T` is not a defined type.
* `x` is the predeclared identifier `nil` and `T` is a pointer, function, slice, map, channel, or interface type.
* `x` is an untyped [constant](#constants) [representable](#representability) by a value of type `T`.

### Representability

A [constant](#constants) `x` is _representable_ by a value of type `T` if one of the following conditions applies:

* `x` is in the set of values [determined](#types) by `T`.
* `T` is a floating-point type and `x` can be rounded to `T`'s precision without overflow. Rounding uses IEEE 754 round-to-even rules but with an IEEE negative zero further simplified to an unsigned zero. Note that constant values never result in an IEEE negative zero, NaN, or infinity.
* `T` is a complex type, and `x`'s [components](#manipulating-complex-numbers) `(real x)` and `(imag x)` are representable by values of `T`'s component type (`float32` or `float64`).

```
x                   T           x representable by a value of T because

```

## Blocks

A _block_ is a possibly empty sequence of declarations and statements.

```
Block         = "(" "begin" StatementList ")" .
StatementList = { Statement } .
```

In addition to explicit blocks in the source code, there are implicit blocks:

1. The _universe block_ encompasses all Slick source text.
2. Each [package](#packages) has a _package block_ containing all Slick source text for that package.
3. Each file has a _file block_ containing all Slick source text in that file.
4. Each ["if"](#if-statements), ["if*"](#if-statements), ["for"](#for-statements), ["while"](#while-statements), ["loop"](#loop-statements), ["range"](#range-statements), ["switch"](#expression-switches), ["switch*"](#expression-switches), ["type-switch"](#type-switches), and ["type-switch*"](#type-switches) statement is considered to be in its own implicit block.
5. Each clause in a ["switch"](#expression-switches) or ["select"](#select-statements) statement acts as an implicit block.

Blocks nest and influence [scoping](#declarations-and-scope).

### Spliced blocks

A _spliced block_ is a possibly empty sequence of declarations and statements.

```
SplicedBlock  = "(" "splice" StatementList ")" .
StatementList = { Statement } .
```

Spliced blocks do not nest and influence [scoping](#declarations-and-scope). A spliced block is treated as if it was replaced by the enclosed statements. The two following functions are equivalent:

```
(func double1 ((x int)) ((_ int))
  (:= y x)
  (= y (+ y x))
  (return y))

(func double2 ((x int)) ((_ int))
  (splice
    (:= y x)
    (= y (+ y x)))
  (return y))
```

Spliced blocks are primarily useful as results from [macro functions](#calls).

## Declarations and scope

A declaration binds a non-[blank](#blank-identifier) identifier to a [constant](#constant-declarations), [type](#type-declarations), [variable](#variable-declarations), [function](#function-declarations), [label](#labeled-statements), [package](#import-declarations), or [plugin](#use-declarations). Every identifier in a program must be declared. No identifier may be declared twice in the same block, and no identifier may be declared in both the file and package block.

The [blank identifier](#blank-identifier) may be used like any other identifier in a declaration, but it does not introduce a binding and thus is not declared. In the package block, the identifier `init` may only be used for [`init` function](#package-initialization) declarations, and like the blank identifier it does not introduce a new binding.

```
Declaration     = ConstDecl | TypeDecl | VarDecl .
TopLevelDecl    = Declaration | FunctionDecl | MethodDecl | SplicedDecl | MacroInvocation | DeclareDecl .
MacroInvocation = CallExpr .
```

The _scope_ of a declared identifier is the extent of source text in which the identifier denotes the specified constant, type, variable, function, label, or package.

Slick is lexically scoped using [blocks](#blocks):

1. The scope of a [predeclared identifier](#predeclared-identifiers) is the universe block.
2. The scope of an identifier denoting a constant, type, variable, or function (but not method) declared at top level (outside any function) is the package block.
3. The scope of the package name of an imported package is the file block of the file containing the import declaration.
4. The scope of an identifier denoting a method receiver, function parameter, or result variable is the function body.
5. The scope of a constant or variable identifier declared inside a function begins at the end of the ConstSpec or VarSpec (ShortVarDecl for short variable declarations) and ends at the end of the innermost containing block.
6. The scope of a type identifier declared inside a function begins at the identifier in the TypeSpec and ends at the end of the innermost containing block.

An identifier declared in a block may be redeclared in an inner block. While the identifier of the inner declaration is in scope, it denotes the entity declared by the inner declaration.

The [package clause](#package-clause) is not a declaration; the package name does not appear in any scope. Its purpose is to identify the files belonging to the same [package](#packages) and to specify the default package name for import declarations.

### Label scopes

Labels are declared by [labeled statements](#labeled-statements) and are used in the ["break"](#break-statements), ["continue"](#continue-statements), and ["goto"](#goto-statements) statements. It is illegal to define a label that is never used. In contrast to other identifiers, labels are not block scoped and do not conflict with identifiers that are not labels. The scope of a label is the body of the function in which it is declared and excludes the body of any nested function.

### Blank identifier

The _blank identifier_ is represented by the underscore character `_`. It serves as an anonymous placeholder instead of a regular (non-blank) identifier and has special meaning in [declarations](#declarations-and-scope), as an [operand](#operands), and in [assignments](#assignments).

### Predeclared identifiers

The following identifiers are implicitly declared in the [universe block](#blocks):
```
Types:
	bool byte complex64 complex128 error float32 float64
	int int8 int16 int32 int64 rune string
	uint uint8 uint16 uint32 uint64 uintptr

Constants:
	true false iota

Zero value:
	nil

Functions:
	append cap close complex copy delete imag len
	make new panic print println real recover
	quote quasiquote unquote unquote-splicing
```

### Exported identifiers

An identifier may be _exported_ to permit access to it from another package. An identifier is exported if both:

1. the first character of the identifier's name is a Unicode upper case letter (Unicode class "Lu"); and
2. the identifier is declared in the [package block](#blocks) or it is a [field name](#struct-types) or [method name](#interface-types).

All other identifiers are not exported.

### Uniqueness of identifiers

Given a set of identifiers, an identifier is called _unique_ if it is _different_ from every other in the set. Two identifiers are different if they are spelled differently, or if they appear in different [packages](#packages) and are not [exported](#exported-identifiers). Otherwise, they are the same.

### Spliced declarations

A _spliced declaration_ is a possibly empty sequence of top-level declarations.

```
SplicedDecl = "(" "splice" { TopLevelDecl } ")" .
```

Spliced declarations do not nest or influence [scoping](#declarations-and-scope). A spliced declaration is treated as if it was replaced by the enclosed declarations.

The following declaration sequence:
```
(splice
  (var x :type int)
  (func init () ()
    (= x 42)))

(var y := x)
```
is equivelant to the next:
```
(var x :type int)
(func init () ()
  (= x 42))
(var y := x)
```

Spliced declarations are primarily useful as results from macro functions.

### Top-level macro invocations

A `MacroInvocation` has the same syntax as a `CallExpr`, but can only invoke identifiers exported from plugins at compile time.

### Declare declarations

A declare declaration sets compiler pragmas for the Go compiler.

```
DeclareDecl = "(" "declare" string ")" .
```

```
(declare "go:noinline")
```

### Constant declarations

A constant declaration binds a list of identifiers (the names of the constants) to the values of a list of [constant expressions](#constant-expressions). The number of identifiers must be equal to the number of expressions, and the nth identifier on the left is bound to the value of the nth expression on the right.

```
ConstDecl      = "(" "const" [Documentation] { identifier | "(" ConstSpec ")" } ) ")" .
ConstSpec      = IdentifierList [[ ":type" Type | ":=" ExpressionList | ":documentation" Documentation ]] .

IdentifierList = identifier | "(" identifier { identifier } ")" .
ExpressionList = Expression | "(" "values" { Expression } ")".
```

If the type is present, all constants take the type specified, and the expressions must be [assignable](#assignability) to that type. If the type is omitted, the constants take the individual types of the corresponding expressions. If the expression values are untyped [constants](#constants), the declared constants remain untyped and the constant identifiers denote the constant values. For instance, if the expression is a floating-point literal, the constant identifier denotes a floating-point constant, even if the literal's fractional part is zero.

```
(const (Pi :type float64 := 3.14159265358979323846))
(const (zero := 0.0 :documentation "untyped floating-point constant"))
(const 
  (size :type int64 := 1024)
  (eof              := -1 :documentation "untyped integer constant"))
(const ((a b c) := (values 3 4 "foo"))); a = 3, b = 4, c = "foo, untyped integer and string constants
(const ((u v) :type float32 := (values 0 3)))    ; u = 0.0, v = 3.0
(const (x :documentation "the order of :type, := and :documentation does not matter" := 5 :type int))
```

Within a `const` declaration list the expression list may be omitted from any but the first ConstSpec. Such an empty list is equivalent to the textual substitution of the first preceding non-empty expression list and its type if any. Omitting the list of expressions is therefore equivalent to repeating the previous list. The number of identifiers must be equal to the number of expressions in the previous list. Together with the [`iota` constant generator](#iota) this mechanism permits light-weight declaration of sequential values:
```
(const
  (Sunday := iota)
  Monday
  Tuesday
  Wednesday
  Thursday
  Friday
  Partyday
  numberOfDays)  ; this constant is not exported
```

### Iota

Within a [constant declaration](#constant-declarations), the predeclared identifier `iota` represents successive untyped integer `constants`. Its value is the index of the respective [ConstSpec](#constant-declarations) in that constant declaration, starting at zero. It can be used to construct a set of related constants:
```
(const
  (c0 := iota)  ; c0 == 0
  (c1 := iota)  ; c1 == 1
  (c2 := iota)) ; c2 == 2

(const
  (a := (<< 1 iota))  ; a == 1  (iota == 0)
  (b := (<< 1 iota))  ; b == 2  (iota == 1)
  (c := 3)            ; c == 3  (iota == 2, unused)
  (d := (<< 1 iota))) ; d == 8  (iota == 3)

(const
  (u               := (* iota 42)   ; u == 0     (untyped integer constant)
  (v :type float64 := (* iota 42))  ; v == 42.0  (float64 constant)
  (w               := (* iota 42))) ; w == 84    (untyped integer constant)

(const (x := iota))  ; x == 0
(const (y := iota))  ; y == 0
```

By definition, multiple uses of `iota` in the same ConstSpec all have the same value:
```
(const
  ((bit0 mask0) := (values (<< 1 iota) (- (<< 1 iota) 1))) ; bit0 == 1, mask0 == 0 (iota == 0)
  ((bit1 mask1))                                           ; bit1 == 2, mask1 == 1 (iota == 1)
  ((_ _))                                                  ; (iota == 2, unused)
  ((bit3 mask3)))                                          ; bit3 == 8, mask3 == 7 (iota == 3)
```

This last example exploits the [implicit repetition](#constant-declarations) of the last non-empty expression list.

### Type declarations

A type declaration binds an identifier, the _type name_, to a [type](#types). Type declarations come in two forms: alias declarations and type definitions.

```
TypeDecl = "(" ("type" | "type-alias") [ Documentation ] ( TypeSpec { TypeSpec } ) ")" .
TypeSpec = "(" TypeDef ")" .
```

#### Alias declarations

An alias declaration binds an identifier to the given type. Within the [scope](#declarations-and-scope) of the identifier, it serves as an _alias_ for the type.

```
(type-alias
  (nodeList (slice (* Node))) ; nodeList and (slice (* Node)) are identical types
  (Polar polar))              ; Polar and polar denote identical types
```

#### Type definitions

A type definition creates a new, distinct type with the same [underlying type](#types) and operations as the given type, and binds an identifier to it.

```
TypeDef = identifier [ Documentation ] Type .
```

The new type is called a _defined type_. It is [different](#type-identity) from any other type, including the type it is created from.

```
(type
  (Point (struct ((x y) :type float64))) ; Point and (struct ((x y) :type float64)) are different types
  (polar Point))                         ; polar and Point denote different types

(type (TreeNode (struct
                  ((left right) :type *TreeNode)
                  (value :type (* Comparable)))))

(type (Block (interface
               (BlockSize () ((_ int)))
               (Encrypt (((src dst) (slice byte))))
               (Decrypt (((src dst) (slice byte)))))))
```

A defined type may have [methods](#method-declarations) associated with it. It does not inherit any methods bound to the given type, but the [method set](#method-sets) of an interface type or of elements of a composite type remains unchanged:
```
;; A Mutex is a data type with two methods, Lock and Unlock.
(type (Mutex (struct               #| Mutex fields |# )))
(func ((m (* Mutex))) Lock   () () #| Lock implementation |# )
(func ((m (* Mutex))) Unlock () () #| Unlock implementation |# )

;; NewMutex has the same composition as Mutex but its method set is empty.
(type (NewMutex Mutex))

;; The method set of PtrMutex's underlying type (* Mutex) remains unchanged,
;; but the method set of PtrMutex is empty.
(type (PtrMutex (* Mutex)))

;; The method set of (* PrintableMutex) contains the methods
;; Lock and Unlock bound to its embedded field Mutex.
(type (PrintableMutex (struct Mutex)))

(type (MyBlock #`MyBlock is an interface type that has the same method set as Block.` Block))
```

Type definitions may be used to define different boolean, numeric, or string types and associate methods with them:
```
(type (TimeZone int))

(const
  (EST :type TimeZone := (- (+ 5 iota)))
  CST
  MST
  PST)

(func ((tz TimeZone)) String () ((_ string))
  (return (fmt:Sprintf "GMT%+dh" tz)))
```

### Variable declarations

A variable declaration creates one or more [variables](#variables), binds corresponding identifiers to them, and gives each a type and an initial value.

```
VarDecl = "(" "var" [ Documentation ] { "(" VarSpec ")" } ")" .
VarSpec = IdentifierList ( [[ { ":type Type" }1 | ":=" ExpressionList | ":documentation" Documentation ]]
| [[ ":type Type" | { ":=" ExpressionList }1 | ":documentation" Documentation ]] ) .
```

```
(var (i :type int))
(var ((U V W) :type float64))
(var (k := 0))
(var ((x y) :type float32 := (values -1 -2)))
(var
  (i       :type int)
  ((u v s) := (values 2.0 3.0 "bar")))
(var ((re im) := (complexSqrt -1)))
(var ((_ found) := (at entries name) :documentation "map lookup")) ; only interested in "found"
(var ((n :documentation "the order of :type, := and :documentation does not matter" := 3 :type int)))
```

If a list of expressions is given, the variables are initialized with the expressions following the rules for [assignments](#assignments). Otherwise, each variable is initialized to its [zero value](#the-zero-value).

If a type is present, each variable is given that type. Otherwise, each variable is given the type of the corresponding initialization value in the assignment. If that value is an untyped constant, it is first implicitly [converted](#conversions) to its [default type](#constants); if it is an untyped boolean value, it is first implicitly converted to type `bool`. The predeclared value `nil` cannot be used to initialize a variable with no explicit type.

```
(var (d := (math:Sin 0.5)))    ; d is float64
(var (i := 42))                ; i is int
(var ((t ok) := (assert x T))) ; t is T, ok is bool
(var (n := nil))               ; illegal
```

Implementation restriction: A compiler may make it illegal to declare a variable inside a [function body](#function-declarations) if the variable is never used.

### Short variable declarations

A _short variable declaration_ uses the syntax:
```
ShortVarDecl = "(" ":=" IdentifierList ExpressionList ")".
```

It is shorthand for a regular [variable declaration](#variable-declarations) with initializer expressions but no types:
```
"(" "var" "(" IdentifierList ":=" ExpressionList ")" ")" .
```

```
(:= (i j) (values 0 10))
(:= f (func () ((_ int)) (return 7)))
(:= ch (make (chan int)))
(:= (r w _) (os:Pipe)) ; (os:Pipe) returns a connected pair of Files and an error, if any
(:= (_ y _) (coord p)) ; (coord) returns three values; only interested in y coordinate
```

Unlike regular variable declarations, a short variable declaration may _redeclare_ variables provided they were originally declared earlier in the same block (or the parameter lists if the block is the function body) with the same type, and at least one of the non-[blank](#blank-identifier) variables is new. As a consequence, redeclaration can only appear in a multi-variable short declaration. Redeclaration does not introduce a new variable; it just assigns a new value to the original.

```
(:= (field1 offset) (nextField str 0))
(:= (field2 offset) (nextField str offset)) ; redeclares offset
(:= (a a) (values 1 2)) ; illegal: double declaration of a or no new variable if a was declared elsewhere
```

Short variable declarations may appear only inside functions. In some contexts such as the initializers for ["if*"](#if-statements), ["for*"](#for-statements), ["switch*"](#expression-switches), or ["type-switch*"](#type-switches) statements, they can be used to declare local temporary variables.

### Function declarations

A function declaration binds an identifier, the _function name_, to a function.

```
FunctionDecl             = "(" "func" FunctionName SignatureAndFunctionBody ] ")" .
SignatureAndFunctionBody = [ Parameters [ Parameters [ Documentation ] [ FunctionBody ] ] ] .
FunctionName             = identifier .
FunctionBody             = StatementList .
```

If the function's [signature](#function-types) declares result parameters, the function body's statement list must end in a [terminating statement](#terminating-statements).

```
(func IndexRune ((s string) (r rune)) ((_ int))
  "invalid: missing return statement"
  (range (:= (i c) s)
    (if (== c r)
      (return i))))
```

A function declaration may omit the body. Such a declaration provides the signature for a function implemented outside Slick, such as an assembly routine.

```
(func min ((x int) (y int)) ((_ int))
  (if (< x y)
    (return x)
    (return y)))

(func flushICache (((begin end) uintptr)) () "implemented externally")
```

### Method declarations

A method is a [function](#function-declarations) with a _receiver_. A method declaration binds an identifier, the _method name_, to a method, and associates the method with the receiver's _base type_.

```
MethodDecl = "(" "func" Receiver MethodName SignatureAndFunctionBody ")" .
Receiver   = Parameters .
```

The receiver is specified via an extra parameter section preceding the method name. That parameter section must declare a single non-variadic parameter, the receiver. Its type must be a [defined](#type-definitions) type `T` or a pointer to a defined type `T`. `T` is called the receiver _base type_. A receiver base type cannot be a pointer or interface type and it must be defined in the same package as the method. The method is said to be _bound_ to its receiver base type and the method name is visible only within [selectors](#selectors) for type `T` or `(* T)`.

A non-[blank](#blank-identifier) receiver identifier must be [unique](#uniqueness-of-identifiers) in the method signature.

For a base type, the non-blank names of methods bound to it must be unique. If the base type is a [struct type](#struct-types), the non-blank method and field names must be distinct.

Given defined type `Point`, the declarations
```
(func ((p (* Point))) Length () ((_ float64))
  (return (math:Sqrt (+ (* (slot p x) (slot p x))
                        (* (slot p y) (slot p y))))))

(func ((p (* Point))) Scale ((factor float64)) ()
  (*= (slot p x) factor)
  (*= (slot p y) factor))
```
bind the methods `Length` and `Scale`, with receiver type `(* Point)`, to the base type `Point`.

The type of a method is the type of a function with the receiver as first argument. For instance, the method `Scale` has type
```
(func ((p (* Point)) (factor float64)))
```
However, a function declared this way is not a method.

## Expressions

An expression specifies the computation of a value by applying operators and functions to operands.

### Operands

Operands denote the elementary values in an expression. An operand may be a literal, a (possibly [qualified](#qualified-identifiers)) non-[blank](#blank-identifier) identifier denoting a [constant](#constant-declarations), [variable](#variable-declarations), or [function](#function-declarations), or a parenthesized expression.

The [blank identifier](#blank-identifier) may appear as an operand only on the left-hand side of an [assignment](#assignments).

```
Operand     = Literal | OperandName | Expression .
Literal     = BasicLit | CompositeLit | FunctionLit .
BasicLit    = int_lit | float_lit | imaginary_lit | rune_lit | string_lit | nil_lit .
OperandName = identifier | QualifiedIdent .
```

### Qualified identifiers

A qualified identifier is an identifier qualified with a package name prefix. The identifier must not be [blank](#blank-identifier). If the package name is blank, it is implicitly set to the predefined package `_keyword`.

```
QualifiedIdent = [ PackageName ] ":" ( identifier | operator ) .
```

A qualified identifier accesses an identifier in a different package, which must be [imported](#import-declarations) or [used](#use-declarations). The identifier must be [exported](#exported-identifiers) and declared in the [package block](#blocks) of that package or plugin. The predefined package `_keyword` is always implicitly imported; it is a virtual package that exports every identifier and operator, including identifiers not starting with an upper case letter.

```
math:Sin	;; denotes the Sin function in package math
:type       ;; denotes the type identifier in package _keyword
:bananaPeel ;; denotes the bananaPeel identifier in package _keyword
:=          ;; denotes the = identifier in package _keyword
```

### Composite literals

Composite literals construct values for structs, arrays, slices, and maps and create a new value each time they are evaluated. They consist of the type of the literal followed by a brace-bound list of elements. Each element may optionally be preceded by a corresponding key.

```
CompositeLit = StructLit | ArrayLit | SliceLit | MapLit .
StructLit    = "(" "make-struct" ( StructType | TypeName ) { FieldName Element } ")" .
ArrayLit     = "(" "make-array" ( ArrayType | TypeName ) { Element } ")" .
SliceLit     = "(" "make-slice" ( SliceType | TypeName ) { Element } ")" .
MapLit       = "(" "make-map" ( MapType | TypeName ) { ( Expression | LiteralValue ) Element } ")" .
FieldName    = identifier .
Element      = Expression | LiteralValue .
```

The LiteralType's underlying type must be a struct, array, slice, or map type respectively (the grammar enforces this constraint except when the type is given as a TypeName). The types of the elements and keys must be [assignable](#assignability) to the respective field, element, and key types of the literal type; there is no additional conversion. The key is interpreted as a field name for struct literals, an index for array and slice literals, and a key for map literals. For map literals, all elements must have a key. It is an error to specify multiple elements with the same field name or constant key value. For non-constant map keys, see the section on [evaluation order](#order-of-evaluation).

For struct literals the following rules apply:

* A key must be a field name declared in the struct type.
* An element list does not need to have an element for each struct field. Omitted fields get the zero value for that field.
* A literal may omit the element list; such a literal evaluates to the zero value for its type.
* It is an error to specify an element for a non-exported field of a struct belonging to a different package.

Given the declarations
```
(type (Point3D (struct ((x y z) :type float64))))
(type (Line (struct ((p q) :type Point3D))))
```
one may write
```
(:= origin (make-struct Point3D)) ; zero value for Point3D
(:= line (make-struct Line p origin q (make-struct Point3D y -4 z 12.3))) ; zero value for (slot (slot line q) x)
```

For array and slice literals the following rules apply:

* Each element has an associated integer index marking its position in the array.
* An element uses the previous element's index plus one. The first element’s index is zero.

[Taking the address](#address-operators) of a composite literal generates a pointer to a unique [variable](#variables) initialized with the literal's value.

```
(var (pointer :type (* Point3D) := (& (make-struct Point3D y 1000))))
```

Note that the [zero value](#the-zero-value) for a slice or map type is not the same as an initialized but empty value of the same type. Consequently, taking the address of an empty slice or map composite literal does not have the same effect as allocating a new slice or map value with [`new`](#allocation).

```
(:= p1 (& (make-slice (slice int)))) ; p1 points to an initialized, empty slice with value (make-slice (slice int)) and length 0
(:= p2 (new (slice int)))            ; p2 points to an uninitialized slice with value nil and length 0
```

The length of an array literal is the length specified in the literal type. If fewer elements than the length are provided in the literal, the missing elements are set to the zero value for the array element type. It is an error to provide elements with index values outside the index range of the array. The notation `...` specifies an array length equal to the maximum element index plus one.

```
(:= buffer (make-array (array 10 string)))           ; (== (len buffer) 10)
(:= intSet (make-array (array 6 int) 1 2 3 5))       ; (== (len intSet) 6)
(:= days (make-array (array ... string) "Sat" "Sun") ; (== (len days) 2)
```

A slice literal describes the entire underlying array literal. Thus the length and capacity of a slice literal are the maximum element index plus one. A slice literal has the form
```
(make-slice (slice T) x1 x2 … xn)
```
and is shorthand for a slice operation applied to an array:
```
(:= tmp (make-array (array n T) x1 x2 … xn))
(slice tmp 0 n)
```

Examples of valid array, slice, and map literals:
```
;; list of prime numbers
(:= primes (make-slice (slice int) 2 3 5 7 9 2147483647))

;; frequencies in Hz for equal-tempered scale (A4 = 440Hz)
(:= noteFrequency (make-map (map string float32)
                    "C0" 16.35 "D0" 18.35 "E0" 20.60 "F0" 21.83
                    "G0" 24.50 "A0" 27.50 "B0" 30.87))
```

### Function literals

A function literal represents an anonymous [function](#function-declarations).

```
FunctionLit = "(" "func" SignatureAndFunctionBody ")" .
```

```
(func (((a b) int) (z float64)) ((_ bool))
  (return (< (* a b) (convert z int))))
```

A function literal can be assigned to a variable or invoked directly.

```
(:= f (func (((x y) int)) ((_ int)) (return (+ x y))))
((func ((ch (chan int))) () (-> ch ACK)) replyChan)
```

Function literals are _closures_: they may refer to variables defined in a surrounding function. Those variables are then shared between the surrounding function and the function literal, and they survive as long as they are accessible.

### Primary expressions

Primary expressions are the operands for unary and binary expressions.

```
PrimaryExpr =
	Operand |
	Conversion |
	MethodExpr |
	Selector |
	Index |
	Slice |
	TypeAssertion |
	CallExpr .

Selector      = "(" "slot" PrimaryExpr identifier ")" .
Index         = "(" "at" PrimaryExpr Expression ")" .
Slice         = "(" "slice" PrimaryExpr Expression [ Expression [ Expression ] ] ")" .
TypeAssertion = "(" "assert" PrimaryExpr Type ")" .
CallExpr      = "(" PrimaryExpr [ Expression { Expression } [ "..." ] ] ")" .
```

```
x
2
(+ s ".txt")
(f 3.1415 true)
(make-struct Point x 1 y 2)
(at m "foo")
(slice s i (+ j 1))
(slot obj color)
((slot (slot f (at p i)) x))
```

### Selectors

For a [primary expression](#primary-expressions) `x` that is not a [package name](#package-clause), the _selector expression_
```
(slot x f)
```
denotes the field or method `f` of the value `x` (or sometimes `(* x)`; see below). The identifier `f` is called the (field or method) _selector_; it must not be the [blank identifier](#blank-identifier). The type of the selector expression is the type of `f`.

A selector `f` may denote a field or method `f` of a type `T`, or it may refer to a field or method `f` of a nested [embedded field](#struct-types) of `T`. The number of embedded fields traversed to reach `f` is called its _depth_ in `T`. The depth of a field or method `f` declared in `T` is zero. The depth of a field or method `f` declared in an embedded field `A` in `T` is the depth of `f` in `A` plus one.

The following rules apply to selectors:

1. For a value `x` of type `T` or `(* T)` where `T` is not a pointer or interface type, `(slot x f)` denotes the field or method at the shallowest depth in `T` where there is such an `f`. If there is not exactly [one `f`](#uniqueness-of-identifiers) with shallowest depth, the selector expression is illegal.
2. For a value `x` of type `I` where `I` is an interface type, `(slot x f)` denotes the actual method with name `f` of the dynamic value of `x`. If there is no method with name `f` in the [method set](#method-sets) of `I`, the selector expression is illegal.
3. As an exception, if the type of `x` is a [defined](#type-definitions) pointer type and `(slot (* x) f)` is a valid selector expression denoting a field (but not a method), `(slot x f)` is shorthand for `(slot (* x) f)`.
4. In all other cases, `(slot x f)` is illegal.
5. If `x` is of pointer type and has the value `nil` and `(slot x f)` denotes a struct field, assigning to or evaluating `(slot x f)` causes a [run-time panic](#run-time-panics).
6. If `x` is of interface type and has the value `nil`, calling or evaluating the method `(slot x f)` causes a [run-time panic](#run-time-panics).

For example, given the declarations:
```
(type (T0 (struct (x :type int))))

(func ((_ (* T0))) M0 () ())

(type (T1 (struct (y :type int))))

(func ((_ T1)) M1 () ())

(type (T2 (struct
            (z :type int)
            (T1)
            ((* T0)))))

(func ((_ (* T2))) M2 () ())

(type (Q (* T2)))

(var (t :type T2))     ; with (slot t T0) != nil
(var (p :type (* T2))) ; with p != nil and (slot (* p) T0) != nil
(var (q :type Q := p))
```
one may write:
```
(slot t z)          ; (slot t z)
(slot t y)          ; (slot (slot t T1) y)
(slot t x)          ; (slot (slot (* t) T0) x)

(slot p z)          ; (slot (* p) z)
(slot p y)          ; (slot (slot (* p) T1) y)
(slot p x)          ; (slot (* (slot (* p) T0)) x)

(slot q x)          ; (slot (* (slot (* q) T0)) x)
                    ; (slot (* q) x) is a valid field selector

((slot p M0))       ; ((slot (slot (* p) T0) M0))
                    ; M0 expects (* T0) receiver
((slot p M1))       ; ((slot (slot  (* p) T1) M1))
                    ; M1 expects T1 receiver
((slot p M2))       ; ((slot p M2))
                    ; M2 expects (* T2) receiver
((slot t M2))       ; ((slot (& t) M2))
                    ; M2 expects (* T2) receiver, see section on Calls
```
but the following is invalid:
```
((slot q M0))       ; (slot (* q) M0) is valid but not a field selector
```

### Method expressions

If `M` is in the [method set](#method-sets) of type `T`, `(slot T M)` is a function that is callable as a regular function with the same arguments as `M` prefixed by an additional argument that is the receiver of the method.

```
MethodExpr   = "(" "slot" ReceiverType MethodName ")" .
ReceiverType = Type .
```

Consider a struct type `T` with two methods, `Mv`, whose receiver is of type `T`, and `Mp`, whose receiver is of type `(* T)`.
```
(type (T (struct (a :type int))))
(func ((tv  T)) Mv ((a int)) ((_ int))            ; value receiver
  (return 0))
(func ((tp (* T))) Mp ((f float32)) ((_ float32)) ; pointer receiver
  (return 1))

(var (t :type T))
```

The expression
```
(slot T Mv)
```
yields a function equivalent to `Mv` but with an explicit receiver as its first argument; it has signature
```
(func ((tv T) (a int)) ((_ int)))
```

That function may be called normally with an explicit receiver, so these five invocations are equivalent:
```
((slot t Mv) 7)
((slot T Mv) t 7)
(begin (:= f1 (slot T Mv)) (f1 t 7))
```

Similarly, the expression
```
(slot (* T) Mp)
```
yields a function value representing `Mp` with signature
```
(func ((tp *T) (f float32)) ((_ float32)))
```

For a method with a value receiver, one can derive a function with an explicit pointer receiver, so
```
(slot (* T) Mv)
```
yields a function value representing `Mv` with signature
```
(func ((tv (* T)) (a int)) ((_ int)))
```

Such a function indirects through the receiver to create a value to pass as the receiver to the underlying method; the method does not overwrite the value whose address is passed in the function call.

The final case, a value-receiver function for a pointer-receiver method, is illegal because pointer-receiver methods are not in the method set of the value type.

Function values derived from methods are called with function call syntax; the receiver is provided as the first argument to the call. That is, given `(:= f (slot T Mv))`, `f` is invoked as `(f t 7)` not `((slot t f) 7)`. To construct a function that binds the receiver, use a [function literal](#function-literals) or [method value](#method-values).

It is legal to derive a function value from a method of an interface type. The resulting function takes an explicit receiver of that interface type.

### Method values

If the expression `x` has static type `T` and `M` is in the [method set](#method-sets) of type `T`, `(slot x M)` is called a _method value_. The method value `(slot x M)` is a function value that is callable with the same arguments as a method call of `(slot x M)`. The expression `x` is evaluated and saved during the evaluation of the method value; the saved copy is then used as the receiver in any calls, which may be executed later.

The type `T` may be an interface or non-interface type.

As in the discussion of [method expressions](#method-expressions) above, consider a struct type `T` with two methods, `Mv`, whose receiver is of type `T`, and `Mp`, whose receiver is of type `(* T)`.

```
(type (T (struct (a :type int))))
(func ((tv  T)) Mv ((a int)) ((_ int))            ; value receiver
  (return 0))
(func ((tp (* T))) Mp ((f float32)) ((_ float32)) ; pointer receiver
  (return 1))

(var (t :type T))
(var (pt :type (* T)))
(func makeT () ((_ T)))
```

The expression
```
(slot t Mv)
```
yields a function value of type
```
(func ((_ int)) ((_ int)))
```

These two function invocations are equivalent:
```
((slot t Mv) 7)
(begin (:= f (slot t Mv)) (f 7))
```

Similarly, the expression
```
(slot pt Mp)
```
yields a function of type
```
(func ((_ float32)) ((_ float32)))
```

As with [selectors](#selectors), a reference to a non-interface method with a value receiver using a pointer will automatically dereference that pointer: `(slot pt Mv)` is equivalent to `(slot (* pt) Mv)`.

As with [method calls](#calls), a reference to a non-interface method with a pointer receiver using an addressable value will automatically take the address of that value: `(slot t Mp)` is equivalent to `(slot (& t) Mp)`.

```
(begin (:= f (slot t Mv)) (f 7))   ; like ((slot t Mv) 7)
(begin (:= f (slot pt Mp)) (f 7))  ; like ((slot pt Mp) 7)
(begin (:= f (slot pt Mv)) (f 7))  ; like ((slot (* pt) Mv) 7)
(begin (:= f (slot t Mp)) (f 7))   ; like ((slot (& t) Mp) 7)
(:= f (slot (makeT) Mp))   ; invalid: result of makeT() is not addressable
```

Although the examples above use non-interface types, it is also legal to create a method value from a value of interface type.

```
(var (i :type (interface (M ((_ int)))) := myVal))
(begin (:= f (slot i M)) (f 7))  ; like ((slot i M) 7)
```

### Index expressions

A primary expression of the form
```
(at a x)
```
denotes the element of the array, pointer to array, slice, string or map `a` indexed by `x`. The value `x` is called the _index_ or _map key_, respectively. The following rules apply:

If `a` is not a map:

* the index `x` must be of integer type or an untyped constant
* a constant index must be non-negative and [representable](#representability) by a value of type `int`
* a constant index that is untyped is given type `int`
* the index `x` is in range if `0 <= x < (len a)`, otherwise it is out of range

For `a` of [array type](#array-types) `A`:

* a [constant](#constants) index must be in range
* if `x` is out of range at run time, a [run-time panic](#run-time-panics) occurs
* `(at a x)` is the array element at index `x` and the type of `(at a x)` is the element type of `A`

For `a` of [pointer](#pointer-types) to array type:

* `(at a x)` is shorthand for `(at (* a) x)`

For `a` of [slice type](#slice-types) `S`:

* if `x` is out of range at run time, a [run-time panic](#run-time-panics) occurs
* `(at a x)` is the slice element at index `x` and the type of `(at a x)` is the element type of `S`

For `a` of [string type](#string-types):

* a [constant](#constants) index must be in range if the string `a` is also constant
* if `x` is out of range at run time, a [run-time panic](#run-time-panics) occurs
* `(at a x)` is the non-constant byte value at index `x` and the type of `(at a x)` is `byte`
* `(at a x)` may not be assigned to

For `a` of [map type](#map-types) `M`:

* `x`'s type must be [assignable](#assignability) to the key type of `M`
* if the map contains an entry with key `x`, `(at a x)` is the map element with key `x` and the type of `(at a x)` is the element type of `M`
* if the map is `nil` or does not contain such an entry, `(at a x)` is the [zero value](#the-zero-value) for the element type of `M`

Otherwise `(at a x)` is illegal.

An index expression on a map `a` of type `(map K V)` used in an [assignment](#assignments) or initialization of the special form
```
(= (values v ok) (at a x))
(:= (v ok) (at a x))
(var ((v ok) := (at a x)))
```
yields an additional untyped boolean value. The value of `ok` is `true` if the key `x` is present in the map, and `false` otherwise.

Assigning to an element of a `nil` map causes a [run-time panic](#run-time-panics).

### Slice expressions

Slice expressions construct a substring or slice from a string, array, pointer to array, or slice. There are two variants: a simple form that specifies a low and high bound, and a full form that also specifies a bound on the capacity.

#### Simple slice expressions

For a string, array, pointer to array, or slice `a`, the primary expression
```
(slice a low high)
```
constructs a substring or slice. The indices `low` and `high` select which elements of operand `a` appear in the result. The result has indices starting at 0 and length equal to `(- high  low)`. After slicing the array `a`
```
(:= a (make-array (array 5 int) 1 2 3 4 5))
(:= s (slice a 1 4))
```
the slice `s` has type `(slice int)`, length 3, capacity 4, and elements
```
(== (at s 0) 2)
(== (at s 1) 3)
(== (at s 2) 4)
```

For convenience, the `high` index may be omitted. A missing `high` index defaults to the length of the sliced operand:
```
(slice a 2)  ; same as (slice a 2 (len a))
```

If `a` is a pointer to an array, `(slice a low high)` is shorthand for `(slice (* a) low high)`.

For arrays or strings, the indices are _in range_ if `0 <= low <= high <= (len a)`, otherwise they are _out of range_. For slices, the upper index bound is the slice capacity `(cap a)` rather than the length. A [constant](#constants) index must be non-negative and [representable](#representability) by a value of type `int`; for arrays or constant strings, constant indices must also be in range. If both indices are constant, they must satisfy `low <= high`. If the indices are out of range at run time, a [run-time panic](#run-time-panics) occurs.

Except for [untyped strings](#constants), if the sliced operand is a string or slice, the result of the slice operation is a non-constant value of the same type as the operand. For untyped string operands the result is a non-constant value of type `string`. If the sliced operand is an array, it must be [addressable](#address-operators) and the result of the slice operation is a slice with the same element type as the array.

If the sliced operand of a valid slice expression is a `nil` slice, the result is a `nil` slice. Otherwise, if the result is a slice, it shares its underlying array with the operand.

```
(var (a (array 10 int)))
(:= s1 (slice a 3 7))  ; underlying array of s1 is array a; (== (& (at s1 2)) (& (at a 5)))
(:= s2 (slice s1 1 4)) ; underlying array of s2 is underlying array of s1 which is array a; (== (& (at s2 1)) (& (at a 5)))
(= (at s2 1) 42)       ; (== (at s2 1) (at s1 2) (at a 5) 42); they all refer to the same underlying array element
```

#### Full slice expressions

For an array, pointer to array, or slice `a` (but not a string), the primary expression
```
(slice a low high max)
```
constructs a slice of the same type, and with the same length and elements as the simple slice expression `(slice low high)`. Additionally, it controls the resulting slice's capacity by setting it to `(- max low)`. After slicing the array `a`
```
(:= a (make-array (array 5 int) 1 2 3 4 5))
(:= t (slice a 1 3 5))
```
the slice `t` has type `(slice int)`, length 2, capacity 4, and elements
```
(== (at t 0) 2)
(== (at t 1) 3)
```
As for simple slice expressions, if `a` is a pointer to an array, `(slice a low high max)` is shorthand for `(slice (* a) low high max)`. If the sliced operand is an array, it must be [addressable](#address-operators).

The indices are _in range_ if `0 <= low <= high <= max <= (cap a)`, otherwise they are _out of range_. A [constant](#constants) index must be non-negative and [representable](#representability) by a value of type `int`; for arrays, constant indices must also be in range. If multiple indices are constant, the constants that are present must be in range relative to each other. If the indices are out of range at run time, a [run-time panic](#run-time-panics) occurs.

### Type assertions

For an expression `x` of [interface type](#interface-types) and a type `T`, the primary expression
```
(assert x T)
```
asserts that `x` is not `nil` and that the value stored in `x` is of type `T`. The notation `(assert x T)` is called a _type assertion_.

More precisely, if `T` is not an interface type, `(assert x T)` asserts that the dynamic type of `x` is identical to the type `T`. In this case, `T` must implement the (interface) type of `x`; otherwise the type assertion is invalid since it is not possible for `x` to store a value of type `T`. If `T` is an interface type, `(assert x T)` asserts that the dynamic type of `x` implements the interface `T`.

If the type assertion holds, the value of the expression is the value stored in `x` and its type is `T`. If the type assertion is false, a [run-time panic](#run-time-panics) occurs. In other words, even though the dynamic type of `x` is known only at run time, the type of `(assert x T)` is known to be `T` in a correct program.

```
(var (x :type (interface) := 7))  ; x has dynamic type int and value 7
(:= i (assert x int))             ; i has type int and value 7

(type (I (interface (m ()))))

(func f ((y I)) ()
  (:= s (assert y string))    ; illegal: string does not implement I
                              ; (missing method m)
  (:= r (assert y io:Reader)) ; r has type io:Reader and the dynamic type
                              ; of y must implement both I and io:Reader
  …
)
```

A type assertion used in an [assignment](#assignments) or initialization of the special form
```
(= (values v ok) (assert x T))
(:= (v ok) (assert x T))
(var ((v ok) := (assert x T)))
(var ((v ok) :type T1 := (assert x T))
```
yields an additional untyped boolean value. The value of `ok` is `true` if the assertion holds. Otherwise it is `false` and the value of `v` is the [zero value](#the-zero-value) for type `T`. No [run-time panic](#run-time-panics) occurs in this case.

### Calls

Given an expression `f` of function type `F`,
```
(f a1 a2 … an)
```
calls `f` with arguments `a1`, `a2`, … `an`.

If `f` is an identifier exported from a plugin, then the call form is passed to the macro function `f` at compile-time together with the current compile-time environment. The macro function returns a replacement form that is further compiled in place of the call form. If the macro function returns a non-`nil` error as a second return value, the compilation aborts reporting that error.

If `f` is not an identifier exported from a plugin, then the call form is a function call. Except for one special case, arguments must be single-valued expressions [assignable](#assignability) to the parameter types of `F` and are evaluated before the function is called. The type of the expression is the result type of `F`. A method invocation is similar but the method itself is specified as a selector upon a value of the receiver type for the method.

```
(math:Atan2 x y)          ; function call
(var (pt (* Point)))
((slot pt Scale) 3.5)     ; method call with receiver pt
```

In a function call, the function value and arguments are evaluated in [the usual order](#order-of-evaluation). After they are evaluated, the parameters of the call are passed by value to the function and the called function begins execution. The return parameters of the function are passed by value back to the calling function when the function returns.

Calling a `nil` function value causes a [run-time panic](#run-time-panics).

As a special case, if the return values of a function or method `g` are equal in number and individually assignable to the parameters of another function or method `f`, then the call `(f (g` _parameters_of_g_`))` will invoke `f` after binding the return values of `g` to the parameters of `f` in order. The call of `f` must contain no parameters other than the call of `g`, and `g` must have at least one return value. If `f` has a final `...` parameter, it is assigned the return values of `g` that remain after assignment of regular parameters.

```
(func Split ((s string) (pos int)) ((_ string) (_ string))
  (return (values (slice s 0 pos) (slice s pos))))

(func Join (((s t) string)) ((_ string))
  (return (+ s t))

(if (!= (Join (Split value (/ (len value) 2))) value)
  (log:Panic "test fails"))
```

A method call `((slot x m))` is valid if the [method set](#method-sets) of (the type of) `x` contains `m` and the argument list can be assigned to the parameter list of `m`. If `x` is [addressable](#address-operators) and `(& x)`'s method set contains `m`, `((slot x m))` is shorthand for `((slot (& x) m))`:
```
(var (p :type Point))
((slot p Scale) 3.5)
```

There is no distinct method type and there are no method literals.

### Passing arguments to variadic parameters

If `f` is [variadic](#function-types) with a final parameter `p` of type `...T`, then within `f` the type of `p` is equivalent to type `(slice T)`. If `f` is invoked with no actual arguments for `p`, the value passed to `p` is `nil`. Otherwise, the value passed is a new slice of type `(slice T)` with a new underlying array whose successive elements are the actual arguments, which all must be [assignable](#assignability) to `T`. The length and capacity of the slice is therefore the number of arguments bound to `p` and may differ for each call site.

Given the function calls
```
(func Greeting ((prefix string) (who ... string)) ())
(Greeting "nobody")
(Greeting "hello:" "Joe" "Anna" "Eileen")
```
within `Greeting`, `who` will have the value `nil` in the first call, and `(make-slice (slice string) "Joe" "Anna" "Eileen")` in the second.

If the final argument is assignable to a slice type `(slice T)`, it is passed unchanged as the value for a `...T` parameter if the argument is followed by `...`. In this case no new slice is created.

Given the slice `s` and call
```
(:= s (make-slice (slice string) "James" "Jasmine"))
(Greeting "goodbye:" s ...)
```
within `Greeting`, `who` will have the same value as `s` with the same underlying array.

### Operators

Operators combine operands into expressions.

```
Expression = UnaryExpr | "(" binary_op Expression Expression ")" .
UnaryExpr  = PrimaryExpr | "(" unary_op UnaryExpr ")" .

binary_op  = "||" | "&&" | rel_op | add_op | mul_op .
rel_op     = "==" | "!=" | "<" | "<=" | ">" | ">=" .
add_op     = "+" | "-" | "|" | "^" .
mul_op     = "*" | "/" | "%" | "<<" | ">>" | "&" | "&^" .

unary_op   = "+" | "-" | "!" | "^" | "*" | "&" | "<-" .
```

Comparisons are discussed [elsewhere](#comparison-operators). For other binary operators, the operand types must be [identical](#type-identity) unless the operation involves shifts or untyped [constants](#constants). For operations involving constants only, see the section on [constant expressions](#constant-expressions).

Except for shift operations, if one operand is an untyped [constant](#constants) and the other operand is not, the constant is implicitly [converted](#conversions) to the type of the other operand.

The right operand in a shift expression must have integer type or be an untyped constant [representable](#representability) by a value of type `uint`. If the left operand of a non-constant shift expression is an untyped constant, it is first implicitly converted to the type it would assume if the shift expression were replaced by its left operand alone.

```
(var (s :type uint := 33))
(var (i := (<< 1 s))                        ; 1 has type int
(var (j :type int32 := (<< 1 s))            ; 1 has type int32; j == 0
(var (k := (convert (<< 1 s) uint64)))      ; 1 has type uint64; k == (<< 1 33)
(var (m :type int := (<< 1.0 s)))           ; 1.0 has type int; m == 0 if ints are 32bits in size
(var (n := (== (<< 1.0 s) j)))              ; 1.0 has type int32; n == true
(var (o := (== (<< 1 s) (<< 2 s))))         ; 1 and 2 have type int; o == true if ints are 32bits in size
(var (p := (== (<< 1 s) (<< 1 33))))        ; illegal if ints are 32bits in size: 1 has type int, but (<< 1 33) overflows int
(var (u := (<< 1.0 s)))                     ; illegal: 1.0 has type float64, cannot shift
(var (u1 := (!= (<< 1.0 s) 0)))             ; illegal: 1.0 has type float64, cannot shift
(var (u2 := (!= (<< 1 s) 1.0)))             ; illegal: 1 has type float64, cannot shift
(var (v :type float32 := (<< 1 s)))         ; illegal: 1 has type float32, cannot shift
(var (w :type int64 := (<< 1.0 33)))        ; (<< 1.0 33) is a constant shift expression
(var (x := (at a (<< 1.0 s))))              ; 1.0 has type int; x == (at a 0) if ints are 32bits in size
(var (a := (make (slice byte) (<< 1.0 s)))) ; 1.0 has type int; (len a) == 0 if ints are 32bits in size
```

#### Operator precedence

Slick is a fully parenthesized language, and therefore does not need operator precedence rules.

### Arithmetic operators

Arithmetic operators apply to numeric values and yield a result of the same type as the first operand. The four standard arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) apply to integer, floating-point, and complex types; `+` also applies to strings. The bitwise logical and shift operators apply to integers only.

```
+    sum                    integers, floats, complex values, strings
-    difference             integers, floats, complex values
*    product                integers, floats, complex values
/    quotient               integers, floats, complex values
%    remainder              integers

&    bitwise AND            integers
|    bitwise OR             integers
^    bitwise XOR            integers
&^   bit clear (AND NOT)    integers

<<   left shift             integer << unsigned integer
>>   right shift            integer >> unsigned integer
```

#### Integer operators

For two integer values `x` and `y`, the integer quotient `(= q (/ x y))` and remainder `(= r (% x y))` satisfy the following relationships:
```
(= x (+ (* q y) r))  and  |r| < |y|
```
with `(/ x y)` truncated towards zero (["truncated division"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation)).

```
 x     y    (/ x y)   (% x y)
 5     3       1         2
-5     3      -1        -2
 5    -3      -1         2
-5    -3       1        -2
```

The one exception to this rule is that if the dividend `x` is the most negative value for the int type of `x`, the quotient `(= q (/ x -1))` is equal to `x` (and `(= r 0)`) due to two's-complement [integer overflow](#integer-overflow):
```
                         x, q
int8                     -128
int16                  -32768
int32             -2147483648
int64    -9223372036854775808
```

If the divisor is a [constant](#constants), it must not be zero. If the divisor is zero at run time, a [run-time panic](#run-time-panics) occurs. If the dividend is non-negative and the divisor is a constant power of 2, the division may be replaced by a right shift, and computing the remainder may be replaced by a bitwise AND operation:
```
 x    (/ x 4)   (% x 4)  (>> x 2)    (& x 3)
 11      2         3         2          3
-11     -2        -3        -3          1
```

The shift operators shift the left operand by the shift count specified by the right operand, which must be non-negative. If the shift count is negative at run time, a [run-time panic](#run-time-panics) occurs. The shift operators implement arithmetic shifts if the left operand is a signed integer and logical shifts if it is an unsigned integer. There is no upper limit on the shift count. Shifts behave as if the left operand is shifted `n` times by 1 for a shift count of `n`. As a result, `(<< x 1)` is the same as `(* x 2)` and `(>> x 1)` is the same as `(/ x 2)` but truncated towards negative infinity.

For integer operands, the unary operators `+`, `-`, and `^` are defined as follows:
```

(+ x)                          is (+ 0 x)
(- x)    negation              is (- 0 x)
(^ x)    bitwise complement    is (^ m x)  with m = "all bits set to 1" for unsigned x and m = -1 for signed x
```

#### Integer overflow

For unsigned integer values, the operations `+`, `-`, `*`, and `<<` are computed modulo 2^n, where _n_ is the bit width of the [unsigned integer](#numeric-types)'s type. Loosely speaking, these unsigned integer operations discard high bits upon overflow, and programs may rely on "wrap around".

For signed integers, the operations `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `<<` may legally overflow and the resulting value exists and is deterministically defined by the signed integer representation, the operation, and its operands. Overflow does not cause a [run-time panic](#run-time-panics). A compiler may not optimize code under the assumption that overflow does not occur. For instance, it may not assume that `(< x (+ x 1))` is always true.

#### Floating-point operators

For floating-point and complex numbers, `(+ x)` is the same as `x`, while `(- x)` is the negation of `x`. The result of a floating-point or complex division by zero is not specified beyond the IEEE-754 standard; whether a [run-time panic](#run-time-panics) occurs is implementation-specific.

An implementation may combine multiple floating-point operations into a single fused operation, possibly across statements, and produce a result that differs from the value obtained by executing and rounding the instructions individually. An explicit floating-point type [conversion](#conversions) rounds to the precision of the target type, preventing fusion that would discard that rounding.

For instance, some architectures provide a "fused multiply and add" (FMA) instruction that computes `(+ (* x y) z)` without rounding the intermediate result `(* x y)`. These examples show when a Slick implementation can use that instruction:
```
;; FMA allowed for computing r, because (* x y) is not explicitly rounded:
(= r (+ (* x y) z))
(begin (= r z) (+= r (* x y)))
(begin (= t (* x y)) (= r (+ t z)))
(begin (= (* p) (* x y)) (= r (+ (* p) z)))
(= r (+ (* x y) (convert z float64)))

;; FMA disallowed for computing r, because it would omit rounding of (* x y):
(= r (+ (convert (* x y) float64) z))
(begin (= r z) (+= r (convert (* x y) float64)))
(begin (= t (convert (* x y) float64)) (= r (+ t z)))
```

#### String concatenation

Strings can be concatenated using the `+` operator or the `+=` assignment operator:
```
(:= s (+ "hi" (string c)))
(+= s " and good bye")
```

String addition creates a new string by concatenating the operands.

### Comparison operators

Comparison operators compare two operands and yield an untyped boolean value.

```
==    equal
!=    not equal
<     less
<=    less or equal
>     greater
>=    greater or equal
```

In any comparison, the first operand must be [assignable](#assignability) to the type of the second operand, or vice versa.

The equality operators `==` and `!=` apply to operands that are _comparable_. The ordering operators `<`, `<=`, `>`, and `>=` apply to operands that are _ordered_. These terms and the result of the comparisons are defined as follows:

* Boolean values are comparable. Two boolean values are equal if they are either both `true` or both `false`.
* Integer values are comparable and ordered, in the usual way.
* Floating-point values are comparable and ordered, as defined by the IEEE-754 standard.
* Complex values are comparable. Two complex values `u` and `v` are equal if both `(== (real u) (real v))` and `(== (imag u) (imag v))`.
* String values are comparable and ordered, lexically byte-wise.
* Pointer values are comparable. Two pointer values are equal if they point to the same variable or if both have value `nil`. Pointers to distinct [zero-size](#size-and-alignment-guarantees) variables may or may not be equal.
* Channel values are comparable. Two channel values are equal if they were created by the same call to [`make`](#making-slices-maps-and-channels) or if both have value `nil`.
* Interface values are comparable. Two interface values are equal if they have [identical](#type-identity) dynamic types and equal dynamic values or if both have value `nil`.
* A value `x` of non-interface type `X` and a value `t` of interface type `T` are comparable when values of type `X` are comparable and `X` implements `T`. They are equal if `t`'s dynamic type is identical to `X` and `t`'s dynamic value is equal to `x`.
* Struct values are comparable if all their fields are comparable. Two struct values are equal if their corresponding non-[blank](#blank-identifier) fields are equal.
* Array values are comparable if values of the array element type are comparable. Two array values are equal if their corresponding elements are equal.

A comparison of two interface values with identical dynamic types causes a [run-time panic](#run-time-panics) if values of that type are not comparable. This behavior applies not only to direct interface value comparisons but also when comparing arrays of interface values or structs with interface-valued fields.

Slice, map, and function values are not comparable. However, as a special case, a slice, map, or function value may be compared to the predeclared identifier `nil`. Comparison of pointer, channel, and interface values to `nil` is also allowed and follows from the general rules above.

```
(const (c := (< 3 4)))           ; c is the untyped boolean constant true

(type (MyBool bool))
(var ((x y) :type int))
(var
  ; The result of a comparison is an untyped boolean.
  ; The usual assignment rules apply.
  (b3              := (== x y))  ; b3 has type bool
  (b4 :type bool   := (== x y))  ; b4 has type bool
  (b5 :type MyBool := (== x y))) ; b5 has type MyBool
```

### Logical operators

Logical operators apply to [boolean](#boolean-types) values and yield a result of the same type as the operands. The right operand is evaluated conditionally.

```
&&    conditional AND    (&& p q)  is  "if p then q else false"
||    conditional OR     (|| p q)  is  "if p then true else q"
!     NOT                (! p)     is  "not p"
```

### Address operators

For an operand `x` of type `T`, the address operation `(& x)` generates a pointer of type `(* T)` to `x`. The operand must be _addressable_, that is, either a variable, pointer indirection, or slice indexing operation; or a field selector of an addressable struct operand; or an array indexing operation of an addressable array. As an exception to the addressability requirement, `x` may also be a [composite literal](#composite-literals). If the evaluation of `x` would cause a [run-time panic](#run-time-panics), then the evaluation of `(& x)` does too.

For an operand `x` of pointer type `(* T)`, the pointer indirection `(* x)` denotes the variable of type `T` pointed to by `x`. If `x` is `nil`, an attempt to evaluate `(* x)` will cause a [run-time panic](#run-time-panics).

```
(& x)
(& (at a (f 2)))
(& (make-struct Point x 2 y 3))
(* p)
(* (pf x))

(var (x :type (* int) := nil))
(* x)     ; causes a run-time panic
(& (* x)) ; causes a run-time panic
```

### Receive operator

For an operand `ch` of [channel type](#channel-types), the value of the receive operation `(<- ch)` is the value received from the channel `ch`. The channel direction must permit receive operations, and the type of the receive operation is the element type of the channel. The expression blocks until a value is available. Receiving from a `nil` channel blocks forever. A receive operation on a [closed](#close) channel can always proceed immediately, yielding the element type's [zero value](#the-zero-value) after any previously sent values have been received.

```
(:= v1 (<- ch))
(= v2 (<- ch))
(f (<- ch))
(<- strobe)  ; wait until clock pulse and discard received value
```

A receive expression used in an [assignment](#assignments) or initialization of the special form
```
(= (values x ok) (<- ch))
(:= (x ok) (<- ch))
(var ((x ok) := (<- ch)))
(var ((x ok) :type T := (<- ch))
```
yields an additional untyped boolean result reporting whether the communication succeeded. The value of `ok` is `true` if the value received was delivered by a successful send operation to the channel, or `false` if it is a zero value generated because the channel is closed and empty.

### Conversions

A conversion changes the [type](#types) of an expression to the type specified by the conversion. A conversion may appear literally in the source, or it may be _implied_ by the context in which an expression appears.

An _explicit_ conversion is an expression of the form `(convert x T)` where `T` is a type and `x` is an expression that can be converted to type `T`.

```
Conversion = "(" "convert" Expression Type ")" .
```

```
(* (convert p Point))
(convert p (* Point))
(<- (convert c (chan int)))
(convert c (<-chan int))
(func () ((_ x)))
(convert x (func ()))
(convert x (func () ((_ int))))
```

A [constant](#constants) value `x` can be converted to type `T` if `x` is [representable](#representability) by a value of `T`. As a special case, an integer constant `x` can be explicitly converted to a [string type](#string-types) using the [same rule](#conversions-to-and-from-a-string-type) as for non-constant `x`.

Converting a constant yields a typed constant as result.

```
(convert iota uint)                            ; iota value of type uint
(convert 2.718281828 float32)                  ; 2.718281828 of type float32
(convert 1 complex128)                         ; (+ 1.0 0.0i) of type complex128
(convert 0.49999999 float32)                   ; 0.5 of type float32
(convert -1e-1000 float64)                     ; 0.0 of type float64
(convert #\x string)                           ; "x" of type string
(convert 0x266c string)                        ; "♬" of type string
(convert (+ "foo" "bar") MyString)             ; "foobar" of type MyString
(convert (make-slice (slice byte) #\a) string) ; not a constant: (make-slice (slice byte) #\a) is not a constant
(convert nil (* int))                          ; not a constant: nil is not a constant, (* int) is not a boolean, numeric, or string type
(convert 1.2 int)                              ; illegal: 1.2 cannot be represented as an int
(convert 65.0 string)                          ; illegal: 65.0 is not an integer constant
```

A non-constant value `x` can be converted to type `T` in any of these cases:

* `x` is [assignable](#assignability) to `T`.
* ignoring struct tags (see below), `x`'s type and `T` have [identical](#type-identity) [underlying types](#types).
* ignoring struct tags (see below), `x`'s type and `T` are pointer types that are not [defined types](#type-definitions), and their pointer base types have identical underlying types.
* `x`'s type and `T` are both integer or floating point types.
* `x`'s type and `T` are both complex types.
* `x` is an integer or a slice of bytes or runes and `T` is a string type.
* `x` is a string and `T` is a slice of bytes or runes.

[Struct tags](#struct-types) are ignored when comparing struct types for identity for the purpose of conversion:
```
(type (Person (struct
                (Name :type string)
                (Address :type (* (struct
                                    (Street :type string)
                                    (City :type string)))))))

(var (data :type (* (struct
                      (Name :type string :tag #`json:"name"`)
                      (Address :type (* (struct
                                          (Street :type string :tag #`json:"street"`)
                                          (City :type string :tag #`json:"city"`)))
                               :tag #`json:"address"`))

(var (person := (convert data (* Person)))) ; ignoring tags, the underlying types are identical
```

Specific rules apply to (non-constant) conversions between numeric types or to and from a string type. These conversions may change the representation of `x` and incur a run-time cost. All other conversions only change the type but not the representation of `x`.

There is no linguistic mechanism to convert between pointers and integers. The package [`unsafe`](#package-unsafe) implements this functionality under restricted circumstances.

#### Conversions between numeric types

For the conversion of non-constant numeric values, the following rules apply:

1. When converting between integer types, if the value is a signed integer, it is sign extended to implicit infinite precision; otherwise it is zero extended. It is then truncated to fit in the result type's size. For example, if `(:= v (convert 0x10F0 uint16))`, then `(== (convert (convert v int8) uint32) 0xFFFFFFF0)`. The conversion always yields a valid value; there is no indication of overflow.
2. When converting a floating-point number to an integer, the fraction is discarded (truncation towards zero).
3. When converting an integer or floating-point number to a floating-point type, or a complex number to another complex type, the result value is rounded to the precision specified by the destination type. For instance, the value of a variable `x` of type `float32` may be stored using additional precision beyond that of an IEEE-754 32-bit number, but `(convert x float32)` represents the result of rounding `x`'s value to 32-bit precision. Similarly, `(+ x 0.1)` may use more than 32 bits of precision, but `(convert (+ x 0.1) float32)` does not.

In all non-constant conversions involving floating-point or complex values, if the result type cannot represent the value the conversion succeeds but the result value is implementation-dependent.

#### Conversions to and from a string type

* Converting a signed or unsigned integer value to a string type yields a string containing the UTF-8 representation of the integer. Values outside the range of valid Unicode code points are converted to `"\uFFFD"`.
```
	(convert #\a string)       ; "a"
	(convert -1 string()       ; (== "\ufffd" "\xef\xbf\xbd")
	(convert 0xf8 string)      ; (== "\u00f8" "ø" "\xc3\xb8")
	(type (MyString string))
	(convert 0x65e5 MyString)  ; (== "\u65e5" "日" "\xe6\x97\xa5")
```
* Converting a slice of bytes to a string type yields a string whose successive bytes are the elements of the slice.
```
	(convert (make-slice (slice byte) #\h #\e #\l #\l #\\xc3 #\\xb8) string) ; "hellø"
	(convert (make-slice (slice byte)) string)                               ; ""
	(convert (convert nil (slice byte)) string)                              ; ""

	(type (MyBytes (slice byte)))
	(convert (make-slice MyBytes #\h #\e #\l #\l #\\xc3 #\\xb8) string)      ; "hellø"
```
* Converting a slice of runes to a string type yields a string that is the concatenation of the individual rune values converted to strings.
```
	(convert (make-slice (slice rune) 0x767d 0x9d6c 0x7fd4) string) ; (== "\u767d\u9d6c\u7fd4" "白鵬翔")
	(convert (make-slice (slice rune)) string)                      ; ""
	(convert (convert nil rune) string)                             ; ""

	(type (MyRunes (slice rune)))
	(convert (make-slice MyRunes 0x767d 0x9d6c 0x7fd4) string)      ; (== "\u767d\u9d6c\u7fd4" "白鵬翔")
```
* Converting a value of a string type to a slice of bytes type yields a slice whose successive elements are the bytes of the string.
```
	(convert "hellø" (slice byte)) ; (make-slice (slice byte) #\h #\e #\l #\l #\\xc3 #\\xb8)
	(convert "" (slice byte))      ; (make-slice (slice byte))

	(convert "hellø" MyBytes)      ; (make-slice (slice byte) #\h #\e #\l #\l #\\xc3 #\\xb8)
```
* Converting a value of a string type to a slice of runes type yields a slice containing the individual Unicode code points of the string.
```
	(convert (convert "白鵬翔" MyString) (slice rune)) ; (make-slice (slice rune) 0x767d 0x9d6c 0x7fd4)
	(convert "" (slice rune))                         ; (make-slice (slice rune))

	(convert "白鵬翔" MyRunes)                         ; (make-slice (slice rune) 0x767d 0x9d6c 0x7fd4)
```

### Constant expressions

Constant expressions may contain only [constant](#constants) operands and are evaluated at compile time.

Untyped boolean, numeric, and string constants may be used as operands wherever it is legal to use an operand of boolean, numeric, or string type, respectively.

A constant [comparison](#comparison-operators) always yields an untyped boolean constant. If the left operand of a constant [shift expression](#operators) is an untyped constant, the result is an integer constant; otherwise it is a constant of the same type as the left operand, which must be of [integer type](#numeric-types).

Any other operation on untyped constants results in an untyped constant of the same kind; that is, a boolean, integer, floating-point, complex, or string constant. If the untyped operands of a binary operation (other than a shift) are of different kinds, the result is of the operand's kind that appears later in this list: integer, rune, floating-point, complex. For example, an untyped integer constant divided by an untyped complex constant yields an untyped complex constant.

```
(const (a := (+ 2 3.0)))                  ; (== a 5.0)   (untyped floating-point constant)
(const (b := (/ 15 4)))                   ; (== b 3)     (untyped integer constant)
(const (c := (/ 15 4.)))                  ; (== c 3.75)  (untyped floating-point constant)
(const (Θ :type float64 := (/ 3 2)))      ; (== Θ 1.0)   (type float64, (/ 3 2) is integer division)
(const (Π :type float64 := (/ 3 2.)))     ; (== Π 1.5)   (type float64, (/ 3 2.) is float division)
(const (d := (<< 1 3.0)))                 ; (== d 8)     (untyped integer constant)
(const (e := (<< 1.0 3)))                 ; e == 8       (untyped integer constant)
(const (f := (<< (convert 1 int32) 33)))  ; illegal      (constant 8589934592 overflows int32)
(const (g := (>> (convert 2 float64) 1))) ; illegal      (float64(2) is a typed floating-point constant)
(const (h := (> "foo" "bar")))            ; (== h true)  (untyped boolean constant)
(const (j := true))                       ; (== j true)  (untyped boolean constant)
(const (k := (+ 'w' 1)))                  ; (== k 'x')   (untyped rune constant)
(const (l := "hi"))                       ; (== l "hi")  (untyped string constant)
(const (m := (convert k string)))         ; (== m "x")   (type string)
(const (Σ := (- 1 0.707i)))               ;              (untyped complex constant)
(const (Δ := (+ Σ 2.0e-4)))               ;              (untyped complex constant)
(const (Φ := (- (* iota 1i) (/ 1 1i))))   ;              (untyped complex constant)
```

Applying the built-in function `complex` to untyped integer, rune, or floating-point constants yields an untyped complex constant.

```
(const (ic := (complex 0 c)))   ; ic == 3.75i  (untyped complex constant)
(const (iΘ := (complex 0 Θ)))   ; iΘ == 1i     (type complex128)
```

Constant expressions are always evaluated exactly; intermediate values and the constants themselves may require precision significantly larger than supported by any predeclared type in the language. The following are legal declarations:
```
(const (Huge := (<< 1 100))) ; (== Huge 1267650600228229401496703205376 (untyped integer constant)
(const (Four :type int8 := (>> Huge 98))) ; Four == 4 (type int8)
```

The divisor of a constant division or remainder operation must not be zero:
```
(/ 3.14 0.0)   ; illegal: division by zero
```

The values of _typed_ constants must always be accurately [representable](#representability) by values of the constant type. The following constant expressions are illegal:
```
(convert -1 uint)    ; -1 cannot be represented as a uint
(convert 3.14 int)   ; 3.14 cannot be represented as an int
(convert Huge int64) ; 1267650600228229401496703205376 cannot be represented as an int64
(* Four 300)         ; operand 300 cannot be represented as an int8 (type of Four)
(* Four 100)         ; product 400 cannot be represented as an int8 (type of Four)
```

The mask used by the unary bitwise complement operator `^` matches the rule for non-constants: the mask is all 1s for unsigned constants and -1 for signed and untyped constants.

```
(^ 1)                 ; untyped integer constant, equal to -2
(convert ^1 uint8)    ; illegal: same as (convert -2 uint8), -2 cannot be represented as a uint8
(^ (convert 1 uint8)) ; typed uint8 constant, same as (== (^ 0xFF (convert 1 uint8)) (convert 0xFE uint8))
(convert ^1 int8)     ; same as (convert -2 int8)
(^ (convert 1 int8))  ; same as (== (^ -1 (convert 1 int8)) -2)
```

Implementation restriction: A compiler may use rounding while computing untyped floating-point or complex constant expressions; see the implementation restriction in the section on [constants](#constants). This rounding may cause a floating-point constant expression to be invalid in an integer context, even if it would be integral when calculated using infinite precision, and vice versa.

### Order of evaluation

At package level, [initialization dependencies](#package-initialization) determine the evaluation order of individual initialization expressions in [variable declarations](#variable-declarations). Otherwise, when evaluating the [operands](#operands) of an expression, assignment, or [return statement](#return-statements), all function calls, method calls, and communication operations are evaluated in lexical left-to-right order.

For example, in the (function-local) assignment
```
(= (values (at y (f)) ok) (values (g (h) (+ (i) (at x (j))) (<- c)) (k))
```
the function calls and communication happen in the order `(f)`, `(h)`, `(i)`, `(j)`, `(<- c)`, `(g)`, and `(k)`. However, the order of those events compared to the evaluation and indexing of `x` and the evaluation of `y` is not specified.

```
(:= a 1)
(:= f (func () ((_ int)) (++ a) (return a)))
(:= x (make-slice (slice int) a (f))) ; x may be (make-slice (slice int) 1 2) or (make-slice (slice int) 2 2): evaluation order between a and (f) is not specified
(:= m (make-map (map int int) a 1 a 2)) ; m may be (make-map (map int int) 2 1) or (make-map (map int int) 2 2): evaluation order between the two map assignments is not specified
(:= n (make-map (map int int) a (f))) ; n may be (make-map (map int int) 2 3) or (make-map (map int int) 3 3): evaluation order between the key and the value is not specified
```

At package level, initialization dependencies override the left-to-right rule for individual initialization expressions, but not for operands within each expression:
```
(var ((a b c) := (values (+ (f) (v)) g() (+ (sqr (u)) (v)))))

(func f () ((_ int))          (return c))
(func g () ((_ int))          (return a))
(func sqr ((x int)) ((_ int)) (return (* x x)))

; functions u and v are independent of all other variables and functions
```
The function calls happen in the order `(u)`, `(sqr)`, `(v)`, `(f)`, `(v)`, and `(g)`.

## Statements

Statements control execution.

```
Statement =
	Declaration | LabeledStmt | SimpleStmt |
	GoStmt | ReturnStmt | BreakStmt | ContinueStmt | GotoStmt |
	FallthroughStmt | Block | SplicedBlock | IfStmt | SwitchStmt |
	SelectStmt | ForStmt | WhileStmt | LoopStmt | RangeStmt | DeferStmt .

SimpleStmt = EmptyStmt | ExpressionStmt | SendStmt | IncDecStmt | Assignment | ShortVarDecl .
```

### Terminating statement

A _terminating statement_ prevents execution of all statements that lexically appear after it in the same [block](#blocks). The following statements are terminating:

1. A ["return"](#return-statements) or ["goto"](#goto-statements) statement.
2. A call to the built-in function [`panic`](#handling-panics).
3. A [block](#blocks) in which the statement list ends in a terminating statement.
4. An ["if"](#if-statements) or ["if*"](#if-statements) statement in which:
   * the "else" branch is present, and
   * both branches are terminating statements.
5. A ["for"](#for-statements), ["while"](#while-statements), or ["loop"](#loop-statements) statement in which:
   * there are no "break" statements referring to the statement, and
   * the condition is absent.
6. A ["switch"](#expression-switches), ["switch*"](#expression-switches), ["type-switch"](#type-switches), or ["type-switch*"](#type-switches) statementin which:
   * there are no "break" statements referring to that statement,
   * there is a default case, and
   * the statement lists in each case, including the default, end in a terminating statement, or a possibly labeled ["fallthrough" statement](#fallthrough-statements).
7. A ["select" statement](#select-statements) in which:
   * there are no "break" statements referring to the "select" statement, and
   * the statement lists in each case, including the default if present, end in a terminating statement.
8. A [labeled statement](#labeled-statements) labeling a terminating statement.

All other statements are not terminating.

A [statement list](#blocks) ends in a terminating statement if the list is not empty and its final non-empty statement is terminating.

### Empty statement

The empty statement does nothing.

```
EmptyStmt = "(" ")" .
```

### Labeled statements

A labeled statement may be the target of a `goto`, `break` or `continue` statement.

```
LabeledStmt = ":" Label Statement .
Label       = identifier .
```

```
:Error (log:Panic "error encountered")
```

### Expression statements

With the exception of specific built-in functions, function, method, and macro [calls](#calls) and [receive operations](#receive-operator) can appear in statement context.

```
ExpressionStmt = Expression .
```

The following built-in functions are not permitted in statement context:
```
append cap complex imag len make new real
unsafe:Alignof unsafe:Offsetof unsafe:Sizeof
```

```
(h (+ x y))
((slot f Close))
(<- ch)
(len "foo")  ; illegal if len is the built-in function
```

### Send statements

A send statement sends a value on a channel. The channel expression must be of [channel type](#channel-types), the channel direction must permit send operations, and the type of the value to be sent must be [assignable](#assignability) to the channel's element type.

```
SendStmt = "(" "->" Channel Expression ")" .
Channel  = Expression .
```

Both the channel and the value expression are evaluated before communication begins. Communication blocks until the send can proceed. A send on an unbuffered channel can proceed if a receiver is ready. A send on a buffered channel can proceed if there is room in the buffer. A send on a closed channel proceeds by causing a [run-time panic](#run-time-panics). A send on a `nil` channel blocks forever.

```
(-> ch 3)  ; send value 3 to channel ch
```

### IncDec statements

The "++" and "--" statements increment or decrement their operands by the untyped [constant](#constants) `1`. As with an assignment, the operand must be [addressable](#address-operators) or a map index expression.

```
IncDecStmt = "(" ( "++" | "--" ) Expression ")" .
```

The following [assignment statements](#assignments) are semantically equivalent:
```
IncDec statement    Assignment
(++ x)               (+= x 1)
(-- x)               (-= x 1)
```

### Assignments

```
Assignment = "(" assign_op ExpressionList ExpressionList ")" .

assign_op = [ add_op | mul_op ] "=" .
```

Each left-hand side operand must be [addressable](#address-operators), a map index expression, or (for `=` assignments only) the [blank identifier](#blank-identifier).

```
(= x 1)
(= (* p) (f))
(= (at a i) 23)
(= k (<- ch))
```

An _assignment operation_ `(`_op_`= x y)` where _op_ is a binary [arithmetic operator](#arithmetic-operators) is equivalent to `(= x (op x y))` but evaluates `x` only once. The _op_`=` construct is a single token. In assignment operations, both the left- and right-hand expression lists must contain exactly one single-valued expression, and the left-hand expression must not be the blank identifier.

```
(<<= (at a i) 2)
(&^= i (<< 1 n))
```

A tuple assignment assigns the individual elements of a multi-valued operation to a list of variables. There are two forms. In the first, the right hand operand is a single multi-valued expression such as a function call, a [channel](#channel-types) or [map](#map-types) operation, or a [type assertion](#type-assertions). The number of operands on the left hand side must match the number of values. For instance, if `f` is a function returning two values,
```
(= (values x y) (f))
```
assigns the first value to `x` and the second to `y`. In the second form, the number of operands on the left must equal the number of expressions on the right, each of which must be single-valued, and the _n_th expression on the right is assigned to the _n_th operand on the left:
```
(= (values one two three) (values '一' '二' '三'))
```

The [blank identifier](#blank-identifier) provides a way to ignore right-hand side values in an assignment:
```
(= _ x)               ; evaluate x but ignore it
(= (values x _) (f))  ; evaluate (f) but ignore second result value
```

The assignment proceeds in two phases. First, the operands of [index expressions](#index-expressions) and [pointer indirections](#address-operators) (including implicit pointer indirections in [selectors](#selectors)) on the left and the expressions on the right are all [evaluated in the usual order](#order-of-evaluation). Second, the assignments are carried out in left-to-right order.

```
(= (values a b) (values b a))  ; exchange a and b

(:= x (make-slice (slice int) 1 2 3))
(:= i 0)
(= (values i (at x i)) (values 1 2))  ; set (= i 1),  (= (at x 0) 2)

(= i 0)
(= (values (at x i) i) (values 2 1))  ; set (= (at x 0) 2), (= i 1)

(= (values (at x 0) (at x 0)) (values 1 2)) ; set (= (at x 0) 1), then (= (at x 0) 2) (so (== (at x 0) 2) at end)

(= (values (at x 1) (at x 3) (values 4 5)) ; set (= (at x 1) 4), then panic setting (= (at x 3) 5)

(type (Point (struct ((x y) :type int)))
(var (p :type (* Point)))
(= (values (at x 2]) (slot p x)) (values 6 7)) ; set (= (at x 2) 6), then panic setting (= (slot p x) 7)

(= i 2)
(= x (make-slice (slice int) 3 5 7))
(range (= (values i (at x i)) x)  ; set (= (values i (at x 2)) (values 0 (at x 0)))
  (break))
; after this loop, (== i 0) and (== x (make-slice (slice int) 3 5 3)
```

In assignments, each value must be [assignable](#assignability) to the type of the operand to which it is assigned, with the following special cases:

1. Any typed value may be assigned to the blank identifier.
2. If an untyped constant is assigned to a variable of interface type or the blank identifier, the constant is first implicitly [converted](#conversions) to its [default type](#constants).
3. If an untyped boolean value is assigned to a variable of interface type or the blank identifier, it is first implicitly converted to type `bool`.

### If statements

"If" statements specify the conditional execution of two branches according to the value of a boolean expression. If the expression evaluates to true, the "if" branch is executed, otherwise, if present, the "else" branch is executed.

```
IfStmt     = "(" "if" Expression Statement [ Statement ] ")" .
IfStarStmt = "(" "if*" SimpleStmt Expression Statement [ Statement ] ")" .
```

```
(if (> x max)
  (= x max))
```

The "if*" expression is preceded by a simple statement, which executes before the expression is evaluated.

```
(if* (:= x (f)) (< x y)
  (return x)
  (if (> x z)
    (return z)
    (return y)))
```

### Switch statements

"Switch" statements provide multi-way execution. An expression or type specifier is compared to the "cases" inside the "switch" to determine which branch to execute.

```
SwitchStmt = ExprSwitchStmt | ExprSwitchStarStmt | TypeSwitchStmt | TypeSwitchStarStmt .
```

There are two forms: expression switches and type switches. In an expression switch, the cases contain expressions that are compared against the value of the switch expression. In a type switch, the cases contain types that are compared against the type of a specially annotated switch expression. The switch expression is evaluated exactly once in a switch statement.

#### Expression switches

In an expression switch, the switch expression is evaluated and the case expressions, which need not be constants, are evaluated left-to-right and top-to-bottom; the first one that equals the switch expression triggers execution of the statements of the associated case; the other cases are skipped. If no case matches and there is a "default" case, its statements are executed. There can be at most one default case and it may appear anywhere in the "switch" statement.

```
ExprSwitchStmt     = "(" "switch" Expression { "(" ExprCaseClause ")" } ")" .
ExprSwitchStarStmt = "(" "switch*" SimpleStmt Expression { "(" ExprCaseClause } ")" } ")" .
ExprCaseClause     = ExprSwitchCase StatementList .
ExprSwitchCase     = BasicLit | OperandName | "(" { Expression } ")" | "default" .
```

If the switch expression evaluates to an untyped constant, it is first implicitly [converted](#conversions) to its [default type](#constants); if it is an untyped boolean value, it is first implicitly converted to type `bool`. The predeclared untyped value `nil` cannot be used as a switch expression.

If a case expression is untyped, it is first implicitly [converted](#conversions) to the type of the switch expression. For each (possibly converted) case expression `x` and the value `t` of the switch expression, `(== x t)` must be a valid [comparison](#comparison-operators).

In other words, the switch expression is treated as if it were used to declare and initialize a temporary variable `t` without explicit type; it is that value of `t` against which each case expression `x` is tested for equality.

In a case or default clause, the last non-empty statement may be a (possibly [labeled](#labeled-statements)) ["fallthrough" statement](#fallthrough-statements) to indicate that control should flow from the end of this clause to the first statement of the next clause. Otherwise control flows to the end of the "switch" statement. A "fallthrough" statement may appear as the last statement of all but the last clause of an expression switch.

The switch* expression is preceded by a simple statement, which executes before the expression is evaluated.

```
(switch tag
  (default   (s3))
  ((0 1 2 3) (s1))
  ((4 5 6 7) (s2)))

(switch* (:= x (f)) true
  (((< x 0)) (return (- x)))
  (default   (return x)))

(switch true
  (((< x y))  (f1))
  (((< x z))  (f2))
  (((== x 4)) (f3)))
```

Implementation restriction: A compiler may disallow multiple case expressions evaluating to the same constant. For instance, the current compilers disallow duplicate integer, floating point, or string constants in case expressions.

#### Type switches

A type switch compares types rather than values. It is otherwise similar to an expression switch.

```
(type-switch _ x
  ;; cases
)
```

Cases then match actual types `T` against the dynamic type of the expression `x`. As with type assertions, `x` must be of [interface type](#interface-types), and each non-interface type `T` listed in a case must implement the type of `x`. The types listed in the cases of a type switch must all be [different](#type-identity).

```
TypeSwitchStmt     = "(" "type-switch" TypeSwitchGuard { "(" TypeCaseClause ")" } ")" .
TypeSwitchStarStmt = "(" "type-switch*" SimpleStmt TypeSwitchGuard { "(" TypeCaseClause ")" } ")" .
TypeSwitchGuard    = identifier PrimaryExpr .
TypeCaseClause     = TypeSwitchCase StatementList .
TypeSwitchCase     = TypeList | "default" .
TypeList           = TypeName | "(" Type { Type } ")" .
```

The TypeSwitchGuard includes an implicit [short variable declaration](#short-variable-declarations). When it is not "_" , the variable is declared at the end of the TypeSwitchCase in the [implicit block](#blocks) of each clause. In clauses with a case listing exactly one type, the variable has that type; otherwise, the variable has the type of the expression in the TypeSwitchGuard.

Instead of a type, a case may use the predeclared identifier `nil`; that case is selected when the expression in the TypeSwitchGuard is a `nil` interface value. There may be at most one `nil` case.

Given an expression `x` of type `(interface)`, the following type switch:
```
(type-switch i x
  (nil (printString "x is nil"))                 ; type of i is type of x (interface)
  (int (printInt i))                             ; type of i is int
  (float64 (printFloat64( i))                    ; type of i is float64
  (((func ((_ int)) ((_ float64))))
   (printFunction i))                            ; type of i is (func ((_ int)) ((_ float64)))
  ((bool string)
   (printString "type is bool or string"))       ; type of i is type of x
  (default (printString "don't know the type"))) ; type of i is type of x
```
could be rewritten:
```
(:= v x)  ; x is evaluated exactly once
(if (== v nil)
  (begin
    (:= i v)                                                                ; type of i is type of x (interface)
    (printString "x is nil"))
  (if* (:= (i isInt) (assert v int)) isInt
    (printInt i)                                                            ; type of i is int
    (if* (:= (i isFloat64) (assert v float64) isFloat64
      (printFloat64 i)                                                      ; type of i is float64
      (if* (:= (i isFunc) (assert v (func ((_ int)) ((_ float64))))) isFunc
        (printFunction i)                                                   ; type of i is (func ((_ int)) ((_ float64)))
        (begin 
          (:= (_ isBool) (assert v bool))
          (:= (_ isString) (assert v string))
	      (if (|| isBool isString)
            (begin
              (:= i v)                                                      ; type of i is type of x
              (printString "type is bool or string"))
            (begin
              (:= i v)                                                      ; type of i is type of x
              (printString "don't know the type"))))))))
```

The type-switch* guard is preceded by a simple statement, which executes before the guard is evaluated.

The "fallthrough" statement is not permitted in a type switch.

### Looping statements

#### Loop statements

A "loop" statement specifies the unconditionally repeated execution of a block.

```
LoopStmt = "(" "loop" StatementList ")" .
```

```
(loop
  (if (>= a b)
    (break))
  (*= a 2))
```

#### While statements

A "while" statement specifies the repeated execution of a block as long as a boolean condition evaluates to true. The condition is evaluated before each iteration.

```
WhileStmt = "(" "while" Condition StatementList ")" .
Condition = Expression .
```

```
(while (< a b)
  (*= a 2))
```

#### For statements

A "for" statement is also controlled by its condition, but additionally it may specify an _init_ and a _post_ statement, such as an assignment, an increment or decrement statement. The init statement may be a [short variable declaration](#short-variable-declarations), but the post statement must not. Variables declared by the init statement are re-used in each iteration.

```
ForStmt   = "(" "for" ForClause StatementList ")" .
ForClause = InitStmt ( Condition | "(" ")" ) PostStmt .
InitStmt  = SimpleStmt .
PostStmt  = SimpleStmt .
```

```
(for (:= i 0) (< i 10) (++ i)
  (f i))
```

If non-empty, the init statement is executed once before evaluating the condition for the first iteration; the post statement is executed after each execution of the block (and only if the block was executed). Any element of the ForClause may be empty. If the condition is absent, it is equivalent to the boolean value `true`.

```
(while cond (S))    is the same as    (for () cond () (S))
(loop       (S))    is the same as    (while true     (S))
```

#### Range statements

A "range" statement iterates through all entries of an array, slice, string or map, or values received on a channel. For each entry it assigns _iteration values_ to corresponding _iteration variables_ if present and then executes the block.

```
RangeStmt   = "(" "range" RangeClause StatementList ")" .
RangeClause = "(" "=" ExpressionList Expression ")" | "(" ":=" IdentifierList Expression ")" .
```

The expression on the right in the "range" clause is called the _range expression_, which may be an array, pointer to an array, slice, string, map, or channel permitting [receive operations](#receive-operator). As with an assignment, if present the operands on the left must be [addressable](#address-operators) or map index expressions; they denote the iteration variables. If the range expression is a channel, at most one iteration variable is permitted, otherwise there may be up to two. If the last iteration variable is the [blank identifier](#blank-identifier), the range clause is equivalent to the same clause without that identifier.

The range expression `x` is evaluated once before beginning the loop, with one exception: if at most one iteration variable is present and `(len x)` is [constant](#length-and-capacity), the range expression is not evaluated.

Function calls on the left are evaluated once per iteration. For each iteration, iteration values are produced as follows if the respective iteration variables are present:
```
Range expression                          1st value          2nd value

array or slice  a  (array n E), 
                   (* (array n E)), or 
                   (slice E)              index    i  int    (at a i)   E
string          s  string type            index    i  int    see below  rune
map             m  (map K V)              key      k  K      (at m k)   V
channel         c  (chan E), (<-chan E)   element  e  E
```

1. For an array, pointer to array, or slice value `a`, the index iteration values are produced in increasing order, starting at element index 0. If at most one iteration variable is present, the range loop produces iteration values from 0 up to `(- (len a) 1)` and does not index into the array or slice itself. For a `nil` slice, the number of iterations is 0.
2. For a string value, the "range" clause iterates over the Unicode code points in the string starting at byte index 0. On successive iterations, the index value will be the index of the first byte of successive UTF-8-encoded code points in the string, and the second value, of type `rune`, will be the value of the corresponding code point. If the iteration encounters an invalid UTF-8 sequence, the second value will be `0xFFFD`, the Unicode replacement character, and the next iteration will advance a single byte in the string.
3. The iteration order over maps is not specified and is not guaranteed to be the same from one iteration to the next. If a map entry that has not yet been reached is removed during iteration, the corresponding iteration value will not be produced. If a map entry is created during iteration, that entry may be produced during the iteration or may be skipped. The choice may vary for each entry created and from one iteration to the next. If the map is `nil`, the number of iterations is 0.
4. For channels, the iteration values produced are the successive values sent on the channel until the channel is [closed](#close). If the channel is `nil`, the range expression blocks forever.

The iteration values are assigned to the respective iteration variables as in an [assignment statement](#assignments).

The iteration variables may be declared by the "range" clause using a form of [short variable declaration](#short-variable-declarations) (`:=`). In this case their types are set to the types of the respective iteration values and their [scope](#declarations-and-scope) is the block of the "for" statement; they are re-used in each iteration. If the iteration variables are declared outside the "for" statement, after execution their values will be those of the last iteration.

```
(var (testdata :type (* (struct (a :type (* (array 7 int)))))))
(range (:= (i _) (slot testdata a))
  ;; testdata.a is never evaluated; (len (slot testdata a)) is constant
  ;; i ranges from 0 to 6
  (f i)))

(var (a :type (array 10 string)))
(range (:= (i s) a) {
  ;; type of i is int
  ;; type of s is string
  ;; (== s (at a i))
  (g i s))

(var (key :type string))
(var (val :type (interface)))  ; element type of m is assignable to val
(:= m (make-map (map string int) "mon" 0  "tue" 1 "wed" 2 "thu" 3 "fri" 4 "sat" 5 "sun" 6))
(range (= (values key val) m)
  (h key val))
;; (== key last) map key encountered in iteration
;; (== val (at map key))

(var (ch :type (chan Work) := (producer)))
(range (:= w ch)
  (doWork w))

;; empty a channel
(range (:= _ ch))
```

### Go statements

A "go" statement starts the execution of a function call as an independent concurrent thread of control, or `goroutine`, within the same address space.

```
GoStmt = "(" "go" Expression ")" .
```

The expression must be a function or method call. Calls of built-in functions are restricted as for [expression statements](#expression-statements).

The function value and parameters are [evaluated as usual](#calls) in the calling goroutine, but unlike with a regular call, program execution does not wait for the invoked function to complete. Instead, the function begins executing independently in a new goroutine. When the function terminates, its goroutine also terminates. If the function has any return values, they are discarded when the function completes.

```
(go (Server))
(go ((func ((ch (chan<- bool))) () (loop (sleep 10) (-> ch true))) c))
```

### Select statements

A "select" statement chooses which of a set of possible [send](#send-statements) or [receive](#receive-operator) operations will proceed. It looks similar to a ["switch"](#expression-switches) statement but with the cases all referring to communication operations.

```
SelectStmt = "(" "select" { "(" CommClause ")" } ")" .
CommClause = CommCase StatementList .
CommCase   = SendStmt | RecvStmt | "default" .
RecvStmt   = "(" "=" ExpressionList RecvExpr ")" | "(" ":=" IdentifierList RecvExpr ")" .
RecvExpr   = Expression .
```

A case with a RecvStmt may assign the result of a RecvExpr to one or two variables, which may be declared using a [short variable declaration](#short-variable-declarations). The RecvExpr must be a receive operation. There can be at most one default case and it may appear anywhere in the list of cases.

Execution of a "select" statement proceeds in several steps:

1. For all the cases in the statement, the channel operands of receive operations and the channel and right-hand-side expressions of send statements are evaluated exactly once, in source order, upon entering the "select" statement. The result is a set of channels to receive from or send to, and the corresponding values to send. Any side effects in that evaluation will occur irrespective of which (if any) communication operation is selected to proceed. Expressions on the left-hand side of a RecvStmt with a short variable declaration or assignment are not yet evaluated.
2. If one or more of the communications can proceed, a single one that can proceed is chosen via a uniform pseudo-random selection. Otherwise, if there is a default case, that case is chosen. If there is no default case, the "select" statement blocks until at least one of the communications can proceed.
3. Unless the selected case is the default case, the respective communication operation is executed.
4. If the selected case is a RecvStmt with a short variable declaration or an assignment, the left-hand side expressions are evaluated and the received value (or values) are assigned.
5. The statement list of the selected case is executed.

Since communication on `nil` channels can never proceed, a select with only `nil` channels and no default case blocks forever.

```
(var (a :type (slice int)))
(var ((c c1 c2 c3 c4) :type (chan int)))
(var ((i1 i2) :type int))
(select
  ((= i1 (<- c1))
   (print "received " i1 " from c1\n"))
  ((-> c2 i2)
   (print "sent " i2 " to c2\n"))
  ((:= (i3 ok) (<- c3))
   (if ok
     (print "received " i3 " from c3\n")
     (print "c3 is closed\n")))
  ((= (at a (f)) (<- c4)))
    ;; same as:
    ;; ((:= t (<- c4))
    ;;  (= (at a (f)) t))
  (default
   (print "no communication\n")))

(loop             ;; send random sequence of bits to c
  (select
    ((-> c 0))    ;; note: no statement, no fallthrough, no folding of cases
    ((-> c 1))))

(select)  ;; block forever
```

### Return statements

A "return" statement in a function `F` terminates the execution of `F`, and optionally provides one or more result values. Any functions [deferred](#defer-statements) by `F` are executed before `F` returns to its caller.

```
ReturnStmt = "(" "return" [ ExpressionList ] ")" .
```

In a function without a result type, a "return" statement must not specify any result values.

```
(func noResult () ()
  (return))
```

There are three ways to return values from a function with a result type:

* The return value or values may be explicitly listed in the "return" statement. Each expression must be single-valued and [assignable](#assignability) to the corresponding element of the function's result type.
```
	(func simpleF () ((_ int))
	  (return 2))

	(func complexF1 () ((re float64) (im float64))
	  (return (values -7.0  -4.0)))
```
* The expression list in the "return" statement may be a single call to a multi-valued function. The effect is as if each value returned from that function were assigned to a temporary variable with the type of the respective value, followed by a "return" statement listing these variables, at which point the rules of the previous case apply.
```
	(func complexF2 () ((re float64) (im float64))
	  (return (complexF1)))
```
* The expression list may be empty if the function's result type specifies names for its [result parameters](#function-types). The result parameters act as ordinary local variables and the function may assign values to them as necessary. The "return" statement returns the values of these variables.
```
	(func complexF3 () ((re float64) (im float64))
	  (= re 7.0)
	  (= im 4.0)
	  (return))

	(func ((_ devnull)) Write ((p (slice byte)) ((n int) (_ error))
	  (= n (len p))
	  (return))
```

Regardless of how they are declared, all the result values are initialized to the [zero values](#the-zero-value) for their type upon entry to the function. A "return" statement that specifies results sets the result parameters before any deferred functions are executed.

Implementation restriction: A compiler may disallow an empty expression list in a "return" statement if a different entity (constant, type, or variable) with the same name as a result parameter is in [scope](#declarations-and-scope) at the place of the return.

```
(func f ((n int)) ((res int) (err error))
  (if* (:= (_ err) (f (- n 1))) (!= err nil) 
     (return))  ;; invalid return statement: err is shadowed
  (return))
```

### Break statements

A "break" statement terminates execution of the innermost ["for"](#for-statements), ["while"](#while-statements), ["loop"](#loop-statements), ["range"](#range-statements), ["switch"](#expression-switches), ["switch*"](#expression-switches), ["type-switch"](#type-switches), ["type-switch*"](#type-switches), or ["select"](#select-statements) statement within the same function.

```
BreakStmt = "(" "break" [ Label ] ")" .
```

If there is a label, it must be that of an enclosing "for", "while", "loop", "range", "switch", "switch*", "type-switch", "type-switch*",  or "select" statement, and that is the one whose execution terminates.

```
:OuterLoop
  (for (= i 0) (< i n) (++ i)
    (for (= j 0) (< j m) (++ j)
      (switch (at (at a i) j)
        (nil
         (= state Error)
         (break OuterLoop))
        (item
         (= state Found)
         (break OuterLoop)))))
```

### Continue statements

A "continue" statement begins the next iteration of the innermost for, while, loop, or range statement at its post statement. The statement must be within the same function.

```
ContinueStmt = "(" "continue" [ Label ] ")" .
```

If there is a label, it must be that of an enclosing "for", "while", "loop", or "range" statement, and that is the one whose execution advances.

```
:RowLoop
  (range (:= (y row) rows)
    (range (:= (x data) row)
      (if (== data endOfRow)
        (continue RowLoop))
      (= (at row x) (+ data (bias x y)))))
```

### Goto statements

A "goto" statement transfers control to the statement with the corresponding label within the same function.

```
GotoStmt = "(" "goto" Label ")" .
```

```
(goto Error)
```

Executing the "goto" statement must not cause any variables to come into [scope](#declarations-and-scope) that were not already in scope at the point of the goto. For instance, this example:
```
	(goto L)  ;; BAD
	(:= v 3)
:L
```
is erroneous because the jump to label `L` skips the creation of `v`.

A "goto" statement outside a block cannot jump to a label inside that block. For instance, this example:
```
(if (== (% n 2) 1)
  (goto L1))
(while (> n 0)
  (f)
  (-- n)
:L1
  (f)
  (-- n))
```
is erroneous because the label `L1` is inside the "while" statement's block but the `goto` is not.

### Fallthrough statements

A "fallthrough" statement transfers control to the first statement of the next case clause in an [expression "switch" statement](#expression-switches). It may be used only as the final non-empty statement in such a clause.

```
FallthroughStmt = "(" "fallthrough" ")" .
```

### Defer statement

A "defer" statement invokes a function whose execution is deferred to the moment the surrounding function returns, either because the surrounding function executed a [return statement](#return-statements), reached the end of its [function body](#function-declarations), or because the corresponding goroutine is [panicking](#handling-panics).

```
DeferStmt = "(" "defer" Expression ")" .
```

The expression must be a function or method call. Calls of built-in functions are restricted as for [expression statements](#expression-statements).

Each time a "defer" statement executes, the function value and parameters to the call are [evaluated as usual](#calls) and saved anew but the actual function is not invoked. Instead, deferred functions are invoked immediately before the surrounding function returns, in the reverse order they were deferred. That is, if the surrounding function returns through an explicit [return statement](#return-statements), deferred functions are executed _after_ any result parameters are set by that return statement but _before_ the function returns to its caller. If a deferred function value evaluates to `nil`, execution [panics](#handling-panics) when the function is invoked, not when the "defer" statement is executed.

For instance, if the deferred function is a [function literal](#function-literals) and the surrounding function has [named result parameters](#function-types) that are in scope within the literal, the deferred function may access and modify the result parameters before they are returned. If the deferred function has any return values, they are discarded when the function completes. (See also the section on [handling panics](#handling-panics).)

```
(lock l)
(defer (unlock l))  ;; unlocking happens before surrounding function returns

;; prints 3 2 1 0 before surrounding function returns
(for (:= i 0) (<= i 3) (++ i)
  (defer (fmt:Print i)))

;; f returns 42
(func f () ((result int))
  (defer ((func () ()
            ;; result is accessed after it was set to 6
            ;; by the return statement
            (*= result 7))))
  (return 6))
```

## Built-in functions

Built-in functions are [predeclared](#predeclared-identifiers). They are called like any other function but some of them accept a type instead of an expression as the first argument.

The built-in functions do not have standard Go types, so they can only appear in [call expressions](#calls); they cannot be used as function values.

### Close

For a channel `c`, the built-in function `(close c)` records that no more values will be sent on the channel. It is an error if `c` is a receive-only channel. Sending to or closing a closed channel causes a [run-time panic](#run-time-panics). Closing the nil channel also causes a [run-time panic](#run-time-panics). After calling `close`, and after any previously sent values have been received, receive operations will return the zero value for the channel's type without blocking. The multi-valued [receive operation](#receive-operator) returns a received value along with an indication of whether the channel is closed.

### Length and capacity

The built-in functions `len` and `cap` take arguments of various types and return a result of type `int`. The implementation guarantees that the result always fits into an `int`.

```

(len s)   string type      string length in bytes
          (array n T), 
          (* (array n T))  array length (== n)
          (slice T)        slice length
          (map K T)        map length (number of defined keys)
          (chan T)         number of elements queued in channel buffer

(cap s)   (array n T), 
          (* (array n T))  array length (== n)
          (slice T)        slice capacity
          (chan T)         channel buffer capacity
```

The capacity of a slice is the number of elements for which there is space allocated in the underlying array. At any time the following relationship holds:
```
(&& (<= 0 (len s)) (<= (len s) (cap s)))
```

The length of a `nil` slice, map or channel is 0. The capacity of a `nil` slice or channel is 0.

The expression `(len s)` is [constant](#constants) if `s` is a string constant. The expressions `(len s)` and `(cap s)` are constants if the type of `s` is an array or pointer to an array and the expression `s` does not contain [channel receives](#receive-operator) or (non-constant) [function calls](#calls); in this case `s` is not evaluated. Otherwise, invocations of `len` and `cap` are not constant and `s` is evaluated.

```
(const
  (c1 := (imag 2i))                                       ; (imag 2i) = 2.0 is a constant
  (c2 := (len (make-array (array 10 float64) 2)))         ; (make-aray ...) contains no function calls
  (c3 := (len (make-array (array 10 float64) c1))         ; (make-array ...) contains no function calls
  (c4 := (len (make-array (array 10 float64) (imag 2i)))) ; (imag 2i) is a constant and no function call is issued
  (c5 := (len (make-array (array 10 float64) (imag z))))) ; invalid: (imag z) is a (non-constant) kfunction call

(var (z :type complex128))
```

### Allocation

The built-in function `new` takes a type `T`, allocates storage for a [variable](#variables) of that type at run time, and returns a value of type `(* T)` [pointing](#pointer-types) to it. The variable is initialized as described in the section on [initial values](#the-zero-value).

```
(new T)
```

For instance
```
(type (S (struct (a :type int) (b :type float64))))
(new S)
```
allocates storage for a variable of type `S`, initializes it (`a=0`, `b=0.0`), and returns a value of type `(* S)` containing the address of the location.

### Making slices, maps and channels

The built-in function `make` takes a type `T`, which must be a slice, map or channel type, optionally followed by a type-specific list of expressions. It returns a value of type `T` (not `(* T)`). The memory is initialized as described in the section on [initial values](#the-zero-value).

```
Call             Type T     Result

(make T n)       slice      slice of type T with length n and capacity n
(make T n m)     slice      slice of type T with length n and capacity m

(make T)         map        map of type T
(make T n)       map        map of type T with initial space for
                            approximately n elements

(make T)         channel    unbuffered channel of type T
(make T n)       channel    buffered channel of type T, buffer size n
```

Each of the size arguments `n` and `m` must be of integer type or an untyped [constant](#constants). A constant size argument must be non-negative and [representable](#representability) by a value of type `int`; if it is an untyped constant it is given type `int`. If both `n` and `m` are provided and are constant, then `n` must be no larger than `m`. If `n` is negative or larger than `m` at run time, a [run-time panic](#run-time-panics) occurs.

```
(:= s (make (slice int) 10 100))    ; slice with (== (len s) 10), (== (cap s) 100)
(:= s (make (slice int) 1e3))       ; slice with (== (len s) (cap s) 1000)
(:= s (make (slice int) (<< 1 63))) ; illegal: (len s) is not representable by a value of type int
(:= s (make (slice int) 10 0))      ; illegal: (> (len s) (cap s))
(:= c (make (chan int) 10))         ; channel with a buffer size of 10
(:= m (make (map string int) 100))  ; map with initial space for approximately 100 elements
```

Calling `make` with a map type and size hint `n` will create a map with initial space to hold `n` map elements. The precise behavior is implementation-dependent.

### Appending and copying slices

The built-in functions `append` and `copy` assist in common slice operations. For both functions, the result is independent of whether the memory referenced by the arguments overlaps.

The [variadic](#function-types) function `append` appends zero or more values `x` to `s` of type `S`, which must be a slice type, and returns the resulting slice, also of type `S`. The values `x` are passed to a parameter of type `...T` where `T` is the [element type](#slice-types) of `S` and the respective [parameter passing rules](#passing-arguments-to-variadic-parameters) apply. As a special case, `append` also accepts a first argument assignable to type `(slice byte)` with a second argument of `string` type followed by `...`. This form appends the bytes of the string.

```
(append ((s S) (x ... T)) ((_ S)))  ; T is the element type of S
```

If the capacity of `s` is not large enough to fit the additional values, `append` allocates a new, sufficiently large underlying array that fits both the existing slice elements and the additional values. Otherwise, `append` re-uses the underlying array.

```
(:= s0 (make-slice (slice int) 0 0))
(:= s1 (append s0 2))                            ; append a single element
                                                 ; (== s1 (make-slice (slice int) 0 0 2))
(:= s2 (append s1 3 5 7))                        ; append multiple elements
                                                 ; (== s2 (make-slice (slice int) 0 0 2 3 5 7))
(:= s3 (append s2 s0 ...))                       ; append a slice
                                                 ; (== s3 (make-slice (slice int) 0 0 2 3 5 7 0 0))
(:= s4 (append (slice s3 3 6) (slice s3 2) ...)) ; append overlapping slice
                                                 ; (== s4 (make-slice (slice int) 3 5 7 2 3 5 7 0 0))

(var (t :type (slice (interface))))
(= t (append t 42 3.1415 "foo"))                 ; (== t (make-slice (slice (interface)) 42 3.1415 "foo"))

(var (b :type (slice byte)))
(= b (append b  "bar" ...))                      ; append string contents
                                                 ; (== b (make-slice (slice byte) 'b' 'a' 'r'))
```

The function `copy` copies slice elements from a source `src` to a destination `dst` and returns the number of elements copied. Both arguments must have [identical](#type-identity) element type `T` and must be [assignable](#assignability) to a slice of type `(slice T)`. The number of elements copied is the minimum of `(len src)` and `(len dst)`. As a special case, `copy` also accepts a destination argument assignable to type `(slice byte)` with a source argument of a string type. This form copies the bytes from the string into the byte slice.

```
(copy (((dst src) (slice T))) ((_ int)))
(copy ((dst (slice byte)) (src string)) ((_ int)))
```

Examples:
```
(var (a := (make-array (array ... int) 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7)))
(var (s := (make (slice int) 6)))
(var (b := (make (slice byte) 5)))
(:= n1 (copy s (slice a 0)))       ; (== n1 6), (== s (make-slice (slice int) 0 1 2 3 4 5))
(:= n2 (copy s (slice s 2)))       ; (== n2 4), (== s (make-slice (slice int) 2 3 4 5 4 5))
(:= n3 (copy b "Hello, World!"))   ; (== n3 5), (== b (make-slice (slice byte) "Hello"))
```

### Deletion of map elements

The built-in function `delete` removes the element with key `k` from a [map](#map-types) `m`. The type of `k` must be [assignable](#assignability) to the key type of `m`.

```
(delete m k)  ; remove element (at m k) from map m
```

If the map `m` is `nil` or the element `(at m k)` does not exist, `delete` is a no-op.

### Manipulating complex numbers

Three functions assemble and disassemble complex numbers. The built-in function `complex` constructs a complex value from a floating-point real and imaginary part, while `real` and `imag` extract the real and imaginary parts of a complex value.

```
(complex (((realPart imaginaryPart) floatT)) ((_ complexT)))
(real ((_ complexT)) ((_ floatT)))
(imag ((_ complexT)) ((_ floatT)))
```

The type of the arguments and return value correspond. For `complex`, the two arguments must be of the same floating-point type and the return type is the complex type with the corresponding floating-point constituents: `complex64` for `float32` arguments, and `complex128` for `float64` arguments. If one of the arguments evaluates to an untyped constant, it is first implicitly [converted](#conversions) to the type of the other argument. If both arguments evaluate to untyped constants, they must be non-complex numbers or their imaginary parts must be zero, and the return value of the function is an untyped complex constant.

For `real` and `imag`, the argument must be of complex type, and the return type is the corresponding floating-point type: `float32` for a `complex64` argument, and `float64` for a `complex128` argument. If the argument evaluates to an untyped constant, it must be a number, and the return value of the function is an untyped floating-point constant.

The `real` and `imag` functions together form the inverse of `complex`, so for a value `z` of a complex type `Z`, `(== z (convert (complex (real z) (imag z)) Z))`.

If the operands of these functions are all constants, the return value is a constant.

```
(var (a := (complex 2 -2)))                       ; complex128
(const (b := (complex 1.0 -1.4)))                 ; untyped complex constant 1 - 1.4i
(:= x (convert (math:Cos (/ math:Pi 2)) float32)) ; float32
(var (c64 := (complex 5 (- x))))                  ; complex64
(var (s :type int := (complex 1 0)))              ; untyped complex constant 1 + 0i, can be converted to int
(= _ (complex 1 (<< 2 s)))                        ; illegal: 2 assumes floating-point type, cannot shift
(var (rl := (real c64)))                          ; float32
(var (im := (imag a)))                            ; float64
(const (c := (imag b)))                           ; untyped constant -1.4
(= _ (imag (<< 3 s)))                             ; illegal: 3 assumes complex type, cannot shift
```

### Handling panics

Two built-in functions, `panic` and `recover`, assist in reporting and handling [run-time panics](#run-time-panics) and program-defined error conditions.

```
(func panic ((_ (interface))))
(func recover () ((_ (interface))))
```

While executing a function `F`, an explicit call to `panic` or a [run-time panic](#run-time-panics) terminates the execution of `F`. Any functions [deferred](#defer-statements) by `F` are then executed as usual. Next, any deferred functions run by `F`'s caller are run, and so on up to any deferred by the top-level function in the executing goroutine. At that point, the program is terminated and the error condition is reported, including the value of the argument to `panic`. This termination sequence is called _panicking_.

```
(panic 42)
(panic "unreachable")
(panic (Error "cannot parse"))
```

The `recover` function allows a program to manage behavior of a panicking goroutine. Suppose a function `G` defers a function `D` that calls `recover` and a panic occurs in a function on the same goroutine in which `G` is executing. When the running of deferred functions reaches `D`, the return value of `D`'s call to `recover` will be the value passed to the call of `panic`. If `D` returns normally, without starting a new `panic`, the panicking sequence stops. In that case, the state of functions called between `G` and the call to `panic` is discarded, and normal execution resumes. Any functions deferred by `G` before `D` are then run and `G`'s execution terminates by returning to its caller.

The return value of `recover` is `nil` if any of the following conditions holds:

* `panic`'s argument was `nil`;
* the goroutine is not panicking;
* `recover` was not called directly by a deferred function.

The `protect` function in the example below invokes the function argument `g` and protects callers from run-time panics raised by `g`.

```
(func protect ((g (func))) ()
  (defer ((func () ()
            (log:Println "done")  ; Println executes normally even if there is a panic
            (if* (:= x (recover)) (!= x nil)
              (log:Printf "run time panic: %v" x)))))
  (log:Println "start")
  (g))
```

### Quotation

The built-in macro function `quote` is used to include literals in Slick code. `(quote` _datum_`)` returns a representation of _datum_ at compile time that leaves _datum_ unevaluated. The _datum_ parameter can be any Slick object as returned by the [Slick reader](#tokens):

* If _datum_ is an [identifier](#identifiers) or [qualified identifier](#qualified-identifiers), `quote` returns a form for constructing a corresponding [`lib:Symbol`](#package-lib) at runtime.
* If _datum_ is a [`list:Pair`](#package-list), `quote` returns a form for constructing a corresponding pair at runtime.
* Otherwise, `quote` returns _datum_ unchanged.

`(quote` _datum_`)` may be abbreviated as `'`_datum_. The two notations are equivalent in all respects.

### Quasiquotation

The built-in macro function `quasiquote` is useful for constructing a list structure, when some but not all of the desired structure is known in advance. The built-in macro functions `unquote` and `unquote-splicing` are used in conjunction with `quasiquote` to specify which parts of the desired structure to evaluate. `(quasiquote` _datum_`)` is equivalent to [`(quote` _datum_`)`](#quotation) if no uses of `unquote` or `unquote-splicing` appear within _datum_.

If an `(unquote` _expression_`)` form appears inside _datum_, however, the expression is evaluated ("unquoted") and its result is inserted into the structure instead of the `unquote` form.

If an `(unquote-splicing` _expression_`)` form appears inside _datum_, then the expression must evaluate to a list; the opening and closing parentheses of the list are then "stripped away" and the elements of the list are inserted in place of the `unquote-splicing` form. Any `unquote-splicing` form must appear only within a list _datum_.

* `(quasiquote` _datum_`)` may be abbreviated as `` ` ``_datum_.
* `(unquote` _expression_`)` may be abbreviated as `,`_expression_.
* `(unquote-splicing` _expresssion_`)` may be abbreviated as `,@`_expression_.

Quasiquote forms may be nested. Substitutions are made only for unquoted components appearing at the same nesting level as the outermost `quasiquote`. The nesting level increases by one inside each successive quasiquotation, and decreases by one inside each unquotation.

### Bootstrapping

Current implementations provide several built-in functions useful during bootstrapping. These functions are documented for completeness but are not guaranteed to stay in the language. They do not return a result.

```
Function   Behavior

print      prints all arguments; formatting of arguments is implementation-specific
println    like print but prints spaces between arguments and a newline at the end
```

Implementation restriction: `print` and `println` need not accept arbitrary argument types, but printing of boolean, numeric, and string [types](#types) must be supported.

## Packages

Go programs are constructed by linking together _packages_. A package in turn is constructed from one or more source files that together declare constants, types, variables and functions belonging to the package and which are accessible in all files of the same package. Those elements may be [exported](#exported-identifiers) and used in another package.

### Source file organization

Each source file consists of a package clause defining the package to which it belongs, followed by a possibly empty set of import declarations that declare packages whose contents it wishes to use, followed by a possibly empty set of declarations of functions, types, variables, and constants.

```
SourceFile = PackageClause { ImportDecl } { UseDecl } { TopLevelDecl } .
```

### Package clause

A package clause begins each source file and defines the package to which the file belongs.

```
PackageClause = "(" "package" PackageName [ Documentation ] ")" .
PackageName   = identifier .
```

The PackageName must not be the [blank identifier](#blank-identifier).

```
(package math)
```

A set of files sharing the same PackageName form the implementation of a package. An implementation may require that all source files for a package inhabit the same directory.

### Import declarations

An import declaration states that the source file containing the declaration depends on functionality of the _imported_ package ([§Program initialization and execution](#program-initialization-and-execution)) and enables access to [exported](#exported-identifiers) identifiers of that package. The import names an identifier (PackageName) to be used for access and an ImportPath that specifies the package to be imported.

```
ImportDecl = "(" "import" { ImportSpec } ")" .
ImportSpec = "(" PackageName ImportPath ")" | ImportPath | "(" "quote" "(" PackageName ImportPath ")" ")" .
ImportPath = string_lit .
```

The PackageName is used in [qualified identifiers](#qualified-identifiers) to access exported identifiers of the package within the importing source file. It is declared in the [file block](#blocks). If the PackageName is omitted, it defaults to the identifier specified in the [package clause](#package-clause) of the imported package. If the import is quoted, then exported identifiers of that package must not be directly accessed, but can be used in qualified identifiers in quoted contexts (either directly quoted, as part of other quoted forms, or as part of quasiquoted forms). Quoted imports where the package name is omitted are currently not supported, but may be added in the future.

The interpretation of the ImportPath is implementation-dependent but it is typically a substring of the full file name of the compiled package and may be relative to a repository of installed packages.

Implementation restriction: A compiler may restrict ImportPaths to non-empty strings using only characters belonging to Unicode's L, M, N, P, and S general categories (the Graphic characters without spaces) and may also exclude the characters ``!"#$%&'()*,:;<=>?[\]^`{|}`` and the Unicode replacement character U+FFFD.

Assume we have compiled a package containing the package clause `(package math)`, which exports function `Sin`, and installed the compiled package in the file identified by `"lib/math"`. This table illustrates how `Sin` is accessed in files that import the package after the various types of import declaration.

```
Import declaration          Local name of Sin

(import "lib/math")             math:Sin
(import (m "lib/math"))         m:Sin
```

An import declaration declares a dependency relation between the importing and imported package. It is illegal for a package to import itself, directly or indirectly, or to directly import a package without referring to any of its exported identifiers. To import a package solely for its side-effects (initialization), use the [blank identifier](#blank-identifier) as explicit package name:

```
(import (_ "lib/math"))
```

### Use declarations

A use declaration states that the source file containing the declaration depends on functionality of the _used_ plugin and enables access to [exported](#exported-identifiers) identifiers of that plugin. A plugin is loaded during compile time, and exported identifiers of that plugin can be used as macros. Macros are functions that receive a source code form and a compile-time environment, and return a replacement source code form and optionally an error message. Macro invocations look like function invocations, but are instead invoked at compile time. A use declaration names an identifier (PackageName) to be used for access and a PackagePath that specifies the package to be used.

```
UseDecl	= "(" "use" { UseSpec } ")" .
UseSpec	= "(" PackageName PackagePath ")" | PackagePath | "(" "quote" "(" PackageName PackagePath ")" ")" .
```

The PackageName is used in [qualified identifiers](#qualified-identifiers) to invoke exported identifiers of the plugin within the importing source file. It is declared in the [file block](#blocks). If the PackageName is omitted, it defaults to the identifier specified as the base of the corresponding PackagePath. If the use declaration is quoted, then exported identifiers of that package must not be directly invoked, but can be used in qualified identifiers in quoted contexts (either directly quoted, as part of other quoted forms, or as part of quasiquoted forms). Quoted use declarations where the PackageName is omitted are currently not supported, but may be added in the future.

Macro functions exported from a plugin must adhere to the following type:
```
(import
  "github.com/pcostanza/slick/list"
  "github.com/pcostanza/slick/compiler")

(func ((form (* list:Pair)) (env compiler:Environment)) ((newForm (interface)) (err error)))
```

A use declaration declares a dependency relation between the package and the plugin. It is illegal for a plugin to use itself, directly or indirectly, or to directly use a plugin without referring to any of its exported identifiers. To use a plugin solely for its side-effects (initialization), use the [blank identifier](#blank-identifier) as explicit PackageName:

```
(use (_ "lib/math"))
```

It is, however, legal for a plugin to declare a quoted use of itself, and return quoted identifiers of itself. This is, in fact, the only way to define self-recursive macros:
```
(package main #`macros are always exported from a main package.
                This is because slick uses Go's plugin functionality,
                and Go plugins are created from main packages`)

(import
  "github.com/pcostanza/slick/list"
  "github.com/pcostanza/slick/compiler")

(use '(b "github.com/pcostanza/bindings"
        "This main package is located in the bindings folder."))

(func LetStar ((form (* list:Pair)) (_ compiler:Environment))
              ((newForm (interface)) (_ error))
  (:= bindings (list:Cadr form))
  (:= body (list:Cddr form))
  (if (== bindings (list:Nil))
    (return (values `(begin ,@body) nil))
    (begin
      (:= firstBinding (list:Car bindings))
      (:= restBindings (list:Cdr bindings))
      (return (values
                `(begin
                   (var (,(list:Car firstBinding) := ,(list:Cadr firstBinding)))
                   (b:LetStar (,@restBindings) ,@body))
                nil)))))
```

### An example package

Here is a complete Go package that implements a concurrent prime sieve.

```
(package main)

(import "fmt")

;; Send the sequence 2, 3, 4, … to channel 'ch'.
(func generate ((ch (chan<- int))) ()
  (for (:= i 2) () (++ i)
    (>- ch i))) ;; Send 'i' to channel 'ch'.

;; Copy the values from channel 'src' to channel 'dst',
;; removing those divisible by 'prime'.
(func filter ((src (<-chan int)) (dst (chan<- int)) (prime int)) ()
  (range (:= i src)  ;; Loop over values received from 'src'.
    (if (!= (% i prime) 0)
      (-> dst i)))) ;; Send 'i' to channel 'dst'.

;; The prime sieve: Daisy-chain filter processes together.
(func sieve () ()
  (:= ch (make (chan int)))  ;; Create a new channel.
  (go (generate ch))         ;; Start (generate) as a subprocess.
  (loop
    (:= prime (<- ch))
    (fmt:Print prime "\n")
    (:= ch1 (make (chan int)))
    (go (filter ch ch1 prime))
    (= ch ch1)))

(func main () ()
  (sieve))
```

## Program initialization and execution

### The zero value

When storage is allocated for a [variable](#variables), either through a declaration or a call of `new`, or when a new value is created, either through a composite literal or a call of `make`, and no explicit initialization is provided, the variable or value is given a default value. Each element of such a variable or value is set to the _zero value_ for its type: `false` for booleans, `0` for numeric types, `""` for strings, and `nil` for pointers, functions, interfaces, slices, channels, and maps. This initialization is done recursively, so for instance each element of an array of structs will have its fields zeroed if no value is specified.

These two simple declarations are equivalent:
```
(var (i :type int))
(var (i :type int := 0))
```

After
```
(type (T (struct (i :type int) (f :type float64) (next :type (* T)))))
(:= t (new T))
```
the following holds:
```
(== (slot t i) 0)
(== (slot t f) 0.0)
(== (slot t next) nil)
```

The same would also be true after:
```
(var t T)
```

### Package initialization

Within a package, package-level variable initialization proceeds stepwise, with each step selecting the variable earliest in _declaration order_ which has no dependencies on uninitialized variables.

More precisely, a package-level variable is considered _ready for initialization_ if it is not yet initialized and either has no [initialization expression](#variable-declarations) or its initialization expression has no _dependencies_ on uninitialized variables. Initialization proceeds by repeatedly initializing the next package-level variable that is earliest in declaration order and ready for initialization, until there are no variables ready for initialization.

If any variables are still uninitialized when this process ends, those variables are part of one or more initialization cycles, and the program is not valid.

Multiple variables on the left-hand side of a variable declaration initialized by single (multi-valued) expression on the right-hand side are initialized together: If any of the variables on the left-hand side is initialized, all those variables are initialized in the same step.

```
(var (x := a))
(var ((a b) := (f))) ;; a and b are initialized together, before x is initialized
```

For the purpose of package initialization, [blank](#blank-identifier) variables are treated like any other variables in declarations.

The declaration order of variables declared in multiple files is determined by the order in which the files are presented to the compiler: Variables declared in the first file are declared before any of the variables declared in the second file, and so on.

Dependency analysis does not rely on the actual values of the variables, only on lexical _references_ to them in the source, analyzed transitively. For instance, if a variable `x`'s initialization expression refers to a function whose body refers to variable `y` then `x` depends on `y`. Specifically:

* A reference to a variable or function is an identifier denoting that variable or function.
* A reference to a method `m` is a [method value](#method-values) or [method expression](#method-expressions) of the form `(slot t m)`, where the (static) type of `t` is not an interface type, and the method `m` is in the [method set](#method-sets) of `t`. It is immaterial whether the resulting function value `(slot t m)` is invoked.
* A variable, function, or method `x` depends on a variable `y` if `x`'s initialization expression or body (for functions and methods) contains a reference to `y` or to a function or method that depends on `y`.

For example, given the declarations
```
(var
  (a := (+ c b))  ;; == 9
  (b := (f))      ;; == 4
  (c := (f))      ;; == 5
  (d := 3))       ;; == 5 after initialization has finished

(func f () ((_ int))
  (++ d)
  (return d))
```
the initialization order is `d`, `b`, `c`, `a`. Note that the order of subexpressions in initialization expressions is irrelevant: `(= a (+ c b))` and `(= a (+ b c))` result in the same initialization order in this example.

Dependency analysis is performed per package; only references referring to variables, functions, and (non-interface) methods declared in the current package are considered. If other, hidden, data dependencies exists between variables, the initialization order between those variables is unspecified.

For instance, given the declarations
```
(var x := ((slot (convert (make-struct T) I) ab))) ; x has an undetected, hidden dependency on a and b
(var (_ := (sideEffect)))  ; unrelated to x, a, or b
(var (a := b))
(var (b := 42))

(type (I (interface (ab () ((_ (slice int))))))
(type (T (struct)))
(func ((_ T))) ab () ((_ (slice int)))
  (return (make-slice (slice int) a b)))
```
the variable `a` will be initialized after `b` but whether `x` is initialized before `b`, between `b` and `a`, or after `a`, and thus also the moment at which `(sideEffect)` is called (before or after `x` is initialized) is not specified.

Variables may also be initialized using functions named `init` declared in the package block, with no arguments and no result parameters.

```
(func init () () … )
```

Multiple such functions may be defined per package, even within a single source file. In the package block, the `init` identifier can be used only to declare `init` functions, yet the identifier itself is not [declared](#declarations-and-scope). Thus `init` functions cannot be referred to from anywhere in a program.

A package with no imports is initialized by assigning initial values to all its package-level variables followed by calling all `init` functions in the order they appear in the source, possibly in multiple files, as presented to the compiler. If a package has imports, the imported packages are initialized before initializing the package itself. If multiple packages import a package, the imported package will be initialized only once. The importing of packages, by construction, guarantees that there can be no cyclic initialization dependencies.

Package initialization — variable initialization and the invocation of `init` functions — happens in a single goroutine, sequentially, one package at a time. An `init` function may launch other goroutines, which can run concurrently with the initialization code. However, initialization always sequences the `init` functions: it will not invoke the next one until the previous one has returned.

To ensure reproducible initialization behavior, build systems are encouraged to present multiple files belonging to the same package in lexical file name order to a compiler.

### Program execution

A complete program is created by linking a single, unimported package called the _main package_ with all the packages it imports, transitively. The main package must have package name `main` and declare a function `main` that takes no arguments and returns no value.

```
(func main () () … )
```

Program execution begins by initializing the main package and then invoking the function `main`. When that function invocation returns, the program exits. It does not wait for other (non-`main`) goroutines to complete.

## Errors

The predeclared type error is defined as
```
(type (error (interface (Error () ((_ string)))))
```

It is the conventional interface for representing an error condition, with the nil value representing no error. For instance, a function to read data from a file might be defined:
```
(func Read ((f (* File)) (b (slice byte))) ((n int) (err error)))
```

## Run-time panics

Execution errors such as attempting to index an array out of bounds trigger a _run-time panic_ equivalent to a call of the built-in function [`panic`](#handling-panics) with a value of the implementation-defined interface type `runtime:Error`. That type satisfies the predeclared interface type [`error`](#errors). The exact error values that represent distinct run-time error conditions are unspecified.

```
(package runtime)

(type (Error (interface error))) ; and perhaps other methods
```

## System considerations

### Package lib

The built-in package `github.com/pcostanza/slick/lib` - in the rest of this specification referred to as just `lib` - is known to the compiler and accessible through the [import path](#import-declarations) `"github.com/pcostanza/slick/lib"`. It provides facilities for handling _symbols_, which are primarily useful for macro programming, but also may have other uses. The package provides the following interface:
```
(package lib)

(type (Symbol (struct ((Package Identifier) :type string))))

(func ((sym (* Symbol))) String () ((_ string)))

(func Intern (((pkg ident) string)) ((_ (* Symbol))))

(func Gensym ((prefix string)) ((_ (* Symbol))))
```

A `Symbol` represents an [identifier](#identifiers) or [operator](#operators-and-punctuation) in Slick source code, with the field `Package` referring to a [package](#package-clause) and `Identifier` referring to a possibly [exported](#exported-identifiers) identifier or operator. If `Package` is the empty string, then the symbol represents an identifier or operator that is local to some unspecified package. If `Package` contains the string `"_keyword"`, then the symbol represents an identifier or operator from the [keyword](#qualified-identifiers) package.

The method `String` defined on `(* Symbol)` returns a string representation of the symbol that corresponds to the grammar for [identifiers](#identifiers), [operators](#operators-and-punctuation) or [qualified identifiers](#qualified-identifiers):

1. If `Package` is the empty string, then `String` returns the contents of `Identifier`.
2. If `Package` is `"_keyword"`, then `String` returns the [concatenation](#string-concatenation) of `":"` and `Identifier`.
3. Otherwise, `String` returns the concatenation of `Package`, `":"` and `Identifier`.

The function `Intern` takes two strings as parameters and returns a value of type `(* Symbol)`. The result is a pointer to a symbol whose `Package` is set to the `pkg` parameter, and whose `Identifier` is set to the `ident` parameter. Subsequent calls of `Intern` with the [same](#comparison-operators) parameters are guaranteed to return the same pointer. `Intern` is safe for concurrent use by multiple goroutines without additional locking or coordination.

The function `Gensym` takes a `prefix` string as a parameter and returns a value of type `(* Symbol)`. The result is a pointer to a symbol whose `Package` is the empty string, and whose `Identifier` is a unique name:

1. If `prefix` is the empty string, then `Identifier` is the [concatenation](#string-concatenation) of `"_g"` and the string representation of a unique integer value.
2. If `prefix` starts with `"_"`, then `Identifier` is the concatenation of `prefix` and the string representation of a unique integer value.
3. Otherwise, `Identifier` is the concatenation of `"_"`, the `prefix` and the string representation of a unique integer value.

Since the `Identifier` of the result of `Gensym` always starts with `"_"`, and the Slick grammar disallows [identifiers](#identifiers) that start with `"_"` (unless it is the [blank identifier](#blank-identifier)), `Gensym` never produces an identifier that can accidentally be in conflict with any identifier in source code.

Since `Gensym` uses a unique integer value as part of the `Identifier`, subsequent calls of `Gensym` never produce identifiers that are accidentally in conflict with any symbol previously returned by `Gensym`.

`Gensym` is safe for concurrent use by multiple goroutines without additional locking or coordination.

### Package list

The built-in package `github.com/pcostanza/slick/list` - in the rest of this specification referred to as just `list` - is known to the compiler and accessible through the [import path](#import-declarations) `"github.com/pcostanza/slick/list"`. It provides facilities for handling Lisp/Scheme-style _pairs_ and _lists_. See the package documentation of that package for more details.

### Package unsafe

The built-in package `unsafe`, known to the compiler and accessible through the [import path](#import-declarations) `"unsafe"`, provides facilities for low-level programming including operations that violate the type system. A package using `unsafe` must be vetted manually for type safety and may not be portable. The package provides the following interface:
```
(package unsafe)

(type (ArbitraryType int)) ; shorthand for an arbitrary Go type; it is not a real type
(type (Pointer (* ArbitraryType)))

(func Alignof ((variable ArbitraryType)) ((_ uintptr)))
(func Offsetof ((selector ArbitraryType)) ((_ uintptr)))
(func Sizeof ((variable ArbitraryType)) ((_ uintptr)))
```

A `Pointer` is a [pointer type](#pointer-types) but a `Pointer` value may not be [dereferenced](#address-operators). Any pointer or value of [underlying type](#types) `uintptr` can be converted to a type of underlying type `Pointer` and vice versa. The effect of converting between `Pointer` and `uintptr` is implementation-defined.

```
(var (f :type float64))
(= bits (* (convert (convert (& f) unsafe:Pointer) (* uint64))))

(type (ptr unsafe:Pointer))
(= bits (* (convert (convert (& f) ptr) (* uint64))))

(var (p :type ptr := nil))
```

The functions `Alignof` and `Sizeof` take an expression `x` of any type and return the alignment or size, respectively, of a hypothetical variable `v` as if `v` was declared via `(var (v := x))`.

The function `Offsetof` takes a (possibly parenthesized) [selector](#selectors) `(slot s f)`, denoting a field `f` of the struct denoted by `s` or `(* s)`, and returns the field offset in bytes relative to the struct's address. If `f` is an [embedded field](#struct-types), it must be reachable without pointer indirections through fields of the struct. For a struct `s` with field `f`:
```
(== (+ (convert (convert (& s) unsafe:Pointer) uintptr) (unsafe:Offsetof (slot s f)))
    (convert (convert (& (slot s f)) unsafe:Pointer) uintptr))
```

Computer architectures may require memory addresses to be _aligned_; that is, for addresses of a variable to be a multiple of a factor, the variable's type's _alignment_. The function `Alignof` takes an expression denoting a variable of any type and returns the alignment of the (type of the) variable in bytes. For a variable `x`:
```
(== (% (convert (convert (& x) unsafe:Pointer) uintptr) (unsafe:Alignof x)) 0)
```

Calls to `Alignof`, `Offsetof`, and `Sizeof` are compile-time constant expressions of type `uintptr`.

### Size and alignment guarantees

For the [numeric types](#numeric-types), the following sizes are guaranteed:
```
type                                 size in bytes

byte, uint8, int8                     1
uint16, int16                         2
uint32, int32, float32                4
uint64, int64, float64, complex64     8
complex128                           16
```

The following minimal alignment properties are guaranteed:

1. For a variable `x` of any type: `(unsafe:Alignof x)` is at least 1.
2. For a variable `x` of struct type: `(unsafe:Alignof x)` is the largest of all the values `(unsafe:Alignof (slot x f))` for each field `f` of `x`, but at least 1.
3. For a variable `x` of array type: `(unsafe:Alignof x)` is the same as the alignment of a variable of the array's element type.

A struct or array type has size zero if it contains no fields (or elements, respectively) that have a size greater than zero. Two distinct zero-size variables may have the same address in memory.
